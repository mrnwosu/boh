## JEWELRY ITEMS

### Crown Pearl Badge: The Official Badge of Kappa Kappa Psi

#### Overview
The **Crown Pearl Badge** is the official means of identifying oneself with Kappa Kappa Psi. Unique among Greek organizations, the purchase of the Crown Pearl Badge is **optional**, making membership a matter of principle rather than material possession.

#### Quick Facts
- **Established:** November 27, 1919 (founding day)
- **Designers:** William H. Coppedge, Clyde Haston, Dick Hurst (three of the ten founding fathers)

- **Purpose:** Official formal identification as a Kappa Kappa Psi member
- **Proper Wearing:** Over the heart, slightly above pocket, positioned toward button-line
- **Status:** One of the oldest continuously used Greek organization badges

#### Symbolism
- **The Crown** - Authority, honor, and leadership
- **The Pearl** - Purity, value, and beauty developed through adversity
- **Greek Letters ΚΚΨ** - The identity and bond of the Fraternity
- **Additional Symbols** - Represent the five purposes and core values of KKPsi

#### Key Facts

**1. Optional Purchase Principle**
Unlike many fraternities where badge purchase is mandatory, Kappa Kappa Psi respects members who choose not to purchase. This reflects KKPsi's core principle that membership is based on shared values, not material possessions.

**2. Design by Founding Fathers**
The Crown Pearl Badge was designed by William H. Coppedge, Clyde Haston, and Dick Hurst—three of the ten founding fathers—as part of the original charter committees.

**3. Historical Continuity**
The design dates to November 27, 1919, the same day Kappa Kappa Psi received its charter. The badge is as old as the Fraternity itself, making it over 100 years old.

**4. Design Stability**
Despite over 100 years of history, the Crown Pearl Badge design remains remarkably consistent. Only minor refinements have been made to the original design.

**5. Customizable Recognition**
Members can attach elements to their badge showing:
- Chapter Greek-letter designation
- Office bars showing current or past offices held
- Years of service denoting tenure and dedication
- Each badge becomes unique to its wearer

**6. Proper Placement Significance**
The specific wearing instructions indicate the serious, official nature of the badge. It is NOT worn on sweatshirts, sports uniforms, or band uniforms—only on formal dress.

**7. Recognition Power**
A member wearing the Crown Pearl Badge is immediately recognizable as a Kappa Kappa Psi member. The distinctive design allows Brothers from different chapters to instantly identify each other's membership.

**8. Premium Quality Materials**
The badge is typically made of high-quality gold (14K or 10K) with pearl accents and high-quality enamel work. This quality ensures the badge lasts a lifetime and beyond, often becoming a family heirloom.

**9. Available Alternatives**
For members preferring not to purchase the full badge:
- **Membership Recognition Pin (Cofa)** - more economical alternative
- **Enameled Recognition Pin** - colorized version for informal occasions
- **Life Member Pin** - for members of 50+ years or special recognition

**10. Ritual Significance**
The presentation of the badge during initiation carries deep meaning. It is not merely a piece of jewelry—it is a symbol of commitment to the Fraternity's ideals and to one's brothers.

## MAJOR AWARDS & SERVICE PROJECTS

It represents the Fraternity and Sorority's commitment to advancing college band music and recognizing excellence in wind band literature.

- **Status:** One of the most prestigious honors in the college band world
- **Operating Since:** 75+ years of continuous operation

#### About the Founder: Dr. F. Lee Bowling
Dr. F. Lee Bowling, Grand President from 1941-1947, envisioned the NIB as a lasting contribution to collegiate music. Rather than simply being a performance ensemble, the NIB was designed to:
- Commission new works from major composers
- Premiere important band compositions
- Bring together the best college musicians
- Advance the art of wind band music

#### Key Facts

**1. Cherished Vision**
Dr. Bowling spent his entire tenure as Grand President (1941-1947) developing and perfecting the plan for the National Intercollegiate Band. It was his "cherished idea" that he was determined to make a reality.

**2. Post-War Creation**
The NIB was established in 1947, just 2 years after World War II ended. This shows the Fraternity's commitment to rebuilding and expanding during a time of national transition and recovery.

**3. Commissioning Program**
One of the most exciting aspects of the NIB is its commissioning program. The Fraternity and Sorority commission major composers to write new works specifically for the NIB—creating new band music literature.
