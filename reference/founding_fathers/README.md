## Historical Context

These ten men founded Kappa Kappa Psi in **Fall 1919** during a period of significant social change in America:

- World War I had just ended (1918)
- Women had just gained the right to vote
- The Spanish Flu pandemic was occurring
- The "Red Scare" and labor unrest were prevalent
- Yet amidst this chaos, these 10 musicians created an organization dedicated to brotherhood, musicianship, and service

## The Power of Ten

What's remarkable about these ten founding fathers is their collaborative spirit. Rather than any one person dominating, they each brought specific skills and perspectives:

- **Visionaries** (Scroggs)
- **Administrators** (Shannon, Stevens, Hendrickson, Hurst)
- **Designers** (Haston, Coppedge)
- **Spiritual Leaders** (Martin, Soule)
- **Scholars** (Nelson)

This diversity of talent and perspective is what allowed Kappa Kappa Psi to develop such a comprehensive and enduring organizational structure.

## Legacy Today
