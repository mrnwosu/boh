## Fun Facts

### 1. **Badge Designer**
Clyde Haston, along with William H. Coppedge, is credited with designing the **Kappa Kappa Psi Badge (Pin)** — the most visible symbol of fraternity membership that millions of brothers have worn since 1919.

### 2. **Agricultural Background**
Haston was the only founding father with Agriculture as his major, bringing a different perspective to the predominantly music and engineering-focused group.

### 3. **Visual Identity Creator**
While A. Frank Martin created the words and philosophy (Ritual), Haston helped create the visual identity that members could wear with pride. Every badge is a piece of Haston's legacy.

### 4. **Early Leadership**
Haston quickly rose to prominence, becoming the **Second Vice President** of the National Fraternity among the first National Officers.

### 5. **Committee Work**
During the fraternity's first year, Haston served on the **Fraternity Pin Design and Coat of Arms Committee**, helping establish visual symbols that would represent the fraternity for generations.

### 6. **Small Town Roots**
Coming from Tribbey, Oklahoma, Haston represented the rural, small-town character of early Oklahoma and the grassroots nature of the fraternity.

### 7. **Long Life in Service**
Although Haston died at a relatively young age (in his 60s), he lived through 44 years of the fraternity's development, from its conception through the mid-20th century.

### 8. **Dual Badge Work**
Haston didn't work alone on the badge. His collaboration with Coppedge shows the importance of partnership and teamwork in creating something that would last over a century.

### 9. **Stillwater Connection**
After his years at Oklahoma A&M, Haston remained connected to Stillwater, and is buried there — showing his deep roots to the founding place.

### 10. **Tangible Legacy**
Unlike some contributions that fade with time, every KKPsi member who wears the badge carries a piece of Clyde Haston with them. His design choices are visible proof of his work.

## Legacy

Clyde Haston's greatest contribution to Kappa Kappa Psi is tangible and permanent — the badge that every member wears. His design work, done in collaboration with Coppedge, created a visual symbol that has endured over 100 years and is recognized by tens of thousands of musicians.
