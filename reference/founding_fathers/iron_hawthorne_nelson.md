## Legacy

Iron Hawthorne Nelson represents the scholar-founder — the person whose work on the Constitution and Bylaws Committee created the structural foundation upon which Kappa Kappa Psi would build.

While his name is less well-known than Scroggs or Martin, Nelson's constitutional work was essential. Every rule that has governed the fraternity, every procedural guideline that chapters follow — these trace back to the framework that Nelson helped establish.

Nelson also represents the interdisciplinary nature of KKPsi from the beginning. While other founding fathers were primarily musicians and educators, Nelson brought the perspective of a chemistry scholar, helping ensure that the fraternity would appeal to musicians and non-musicians alike across the entire campus community.

The chemistry student from Stillwater, Oklahoma helped mix the right elements to create a fraternal compound that would endure for over a century.
