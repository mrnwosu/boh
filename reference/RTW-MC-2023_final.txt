A NOTE TO THE MEMBERSHIP CANDIDATE You have accepted an invitation to join this unique organization and commit yourself to do all you  can to build a better band on your campus. Much will be expected of you, for our Brothers are known  throughout the nation as doers, not just talkers. The Purpose of Kappa Kappa Psi’s Membership  Education Program:  The Road to Wisdom personally and professionally through service to college bands. Because membership in Kappa Kappa  Psi is a perpetual process of growth, this Guidebook is to serve as an ongoing resource during your  Active Membership. What is Kappa Kappa Psi? Kappa Kappa Psi exists on several levels, and one would need to address  each of these aspects to provide a complete answer. The most direct response, is that Kappa Kappa Psi  is YOU! The Fraternity is the collective personalities and experiences of its Brothers – past, present,  and future. Our members are drawn together with one special interest in mind: BAND! It is this  desire that defines our organization and serves as the focus for all our endeavors. Kappa Kappa Psi is a co-educational fraternal organization dedicated to the service, promotion, and  advancement of college and university bands. Our Active Members provide musicianship, service, and  leadership to over 200 band programs across the United States. As such, Brothers are often referred to  as the “backbone” of their respective band program.  This Guidebook has four purposes: a) to introduce you to the basic concepts of Kappa Kappa Psi; b)  to provide you with some working knowledge of the Fraternity you have elected to join; c) to act as a  material supplement for additional information about your band and its relationship to the National  Fraternity; and d) to provide you with the tools and skills necessary for personal development. The  very nature of the Guidebook lends itself to the addition and inclusion of materials more pertinent to  your Chapter and band program and its own history, traditions and customs. The Chapter will provide  this additional “localized” material to assist in your instruction; you should request it if it does not  appear in this Guide. You are equally responsible for knowledge of this local information. You have begun a journey along the path of service towards Active Membership in our Brotherhood.  The National Council wishes you well on your way, and commits to you our continued assistance  and concern. We look forward to the day when we may greet you as a member and Brother of Kappa  Kappa Psi.
 is to challenge you to “Strive for the Highest” as you grow

PROJECT PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICE PROJECT:  Service is a core value of Kappa Kappa Psi and a cornerstone of the  National Brand.  It is an integral part of the operation of your local chapter of Kappa Kappa  Psi. Brothers of Kappa Kappa Psi are often looking to identify a void in the band Program  and fill the void through their service, whether it is an everyday activity, such as setting-up and  breaking down the band room before and after band rehearsals, or a major one-time project,  such as organizing the logistics for a band trip. A conversation with your Director of Bands  and/or Chapter Sponsor regarding the needs of the band program can be incredibly helpful as  you plan and execute a service project with your Membership Candidate class and the active  chapter.  Your Membership Candidate class will work with the chapter officer who oversees  service within your chapter to help develop and execute this service project. FUNDRAISER:  Successful fundraisers should have a purpose, and in Kappa Kappa Psi, the  purpose of a fundraiser should support the band program. It is important to set goals and  determine how much money is needed to fund the anticipated project. As a Membership  Candidate class, one of your endeavors is to execute a fundraiser. Your Membership Candidate  class will work collaboratively with the Chapter Treasurer to help develop and execute the  fundraising project. Please see  Appendix A  for a list of Service and Fundraising project ideas. PORTFOLIO PROJECT : The Portfolio Project is an ongoing reflection of learning from  the membership candidacy.  The purpose is for Membership Candidates to reflect on their  experience, and highlight meaningful learning moments throughout the process. There is  a list of options for your project, but you may wish to create something outside of this list,  which is permissible.  The Portfolio project should be worked on throughout the Membership  Candidacy.  Your Vice President of Membership will check in with you each time you meet  to evaluate your progress on this project.   This is a required piece of the Road to Wisdom. Portfolio Project Presentations should occur in the Final Lesson.    FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY:  Fees to Kappa Kappa Psi are to be paid to the Chapter  Treasurer. The outline of your National fees and a timeline of when to pay them will be made  known to you by your Chapter Vice President of Membership. The Initiate Registration fee  is due in full to your Chapter Treasurer by Third Degree. Your chapter may also require the  payment of chapter fees as well, and the Vice President of Membership will provide you with  an outline of the cost of your chapter fees and a timeline of when to pay them. All annual dues  and fees must be paid up to date to maintain Active Membership in the Fraternity.  Please see the Paperwork and Fees Grid in  Appendix B  for a detailed list of National Fees and  information due to the National Chapter.

MATERIALS PROVIDED TO MEMBERSHIP CANDIDATES Materials will be provided to you at First Degree of the Ritual THE MEMBERSHIP CANDIDATE PIN At the First Degree of the Ritual, you will be given a  Membership Candidate Pin. This is a lapel pin of blue  and silver, with symbols inscribed thereon that identifies  you as a prospective member of the Fraternity. It is to be  worn on the left side, over the heart. It is not to be worn  on sweatshirts, sports uniforms, or on the band uniform. Any  exceptions for other occasions or situations will be explained  to you by your Vice President of Membership. This pin  should not be worn at all times. If advised to do so, please  note that this is not in line with Kappa Kappa Psi’s Policy  on Hazing. THE MEMBERSHIP CANDIDATE GUIDEBOOK The Membership Candidate Guidebook is to be used as  an instructional tool for your Membership Education  Program. All lesson information within the Membership  Education Program, as well as documents within the  Appendix and additional chapter specific information will  be located in your Membership Candidate Guidebook.

NOTES REGARDING RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND HAZING 



PORTFOLIO PROJECT THE ROAD TO WISDOM PORTFOLIO PROJECT The  “Road to Wisdom”  membership education program no longer has written or verbal tests, quizzes,  or a final exam. This was not an oversight of the National Curriculum committee.  The overarching  goal of the program is for our members to live the values of the Ritual, and the program has been  intentionally designed in this way. The candidate will present their portfolio to the full chapter prior to  3rd degree and is a physical representation of what they learned during the membership process. Tests and quizzes are absolutely barred from the National Membership Education Program:  The Road to Wisdom  and the entirety of the Membership Education Program.  The portfolio should be introduced to the candidate at the end of the Candidate Orientation Meeting  and prior to first degree.  Candidates should add to their portfolio to document their experiences on  “The Road to Wisdom”. This can be documented by the membership candidate through examples  such as journaling, scrapbooking, drawing - whatever form the Membership Candidates choose to  reflect their journey. The portfolio concept allows each individual candidate an outlet for the them to express themselves  artistically.  Each candidate would highlight what individuals view as most important, impactful, or  meaningful they learned from the program. The portfolio concept provides a personal connection and  touch. There are no specific requirements on what the portfolio should look like. The only requirement is the  membership candidate must explain their project and how it relates to what they learned throughout  the  “Road to Wisdom” . The Vice President of Membership or the Membership Candidate’s big brother will periodically  check in and work with them to review material covered in the Kappa Kappa Psi Fraternity National  Membership Education Program:  The Road to Wisdom to the deadline.
 and ensure that the portfolio is completed prior 

Here are some example projects that can be created for a portfolio: Technology Video Create a video about  your membership  education experience.   It can be in the style of  a movie, documentary,  interview, game show,  music video, or other  creative outlet.  You  can use websites/ apps such as Animoto  (www.animoto. com), Go! Animate  (https://goanimate. com)  iMovie, or movie  maker to create this! Written/Visual Scrapbook Using Scrapbook  materials, create a  visual experience of  your membership  education program  outlining what you’ve  learned through your  experience.
Hands-On Kappa Kappa Cake  Decorating Decorate a cake  that depicts what  you’ve learned from  your membership  education program.   Use icing, M&Ms,  Fruit By The Foot,  gummy bears, and  more to “create” your  story.   Written Journal/Blog Using a website  or a physical  notebook/journal,  create a series  of entries about  your membership  education experience  and what you have  learned throughout  your time as a  membership  candidate.

Create  a playlist of music  to share with your  chapter and describe  how each song is  reflective of your  learning.  Written/Visual Powerpoint/Prezi Create a powerpoint,  Prezi (https://prezi. com), or other  visual outlining your  membership education  experience and what  you have learned  throughout your time  as a membership  candidate.

Written/Technology Before and After Create a before and  after project based  on your time as a  membership candidate.  Identify where you  were and how you got  started versus where  you are now. Focus on  how your perspectives  have perhaps changed  on areas such as  service, leadership,  or brotherhood.  Instead of yourself  you could choose a  Brother and complete  the same project.  You could create a  video, slideshow, or  presentation
Written/Verbal Song/Rap/Poem Write a song, rap, or  poem that describes  what you have  learned throughout  your time as a  membership  candidate.   Written/Visual The Hero You Know Select someone you  admire and look up  to as a role model  or hero.

PREAMBLE TO THE NATIONAL CONSTITUTION OF KAPPA KAPPA PSI Be it known that Kappa Kappa Psi, National Honorary Band Fraternity for College  Bandmembers, is an organization operating exclusively in the field of the college and  university bands, and for the following several purposes: (1) To promote the existence and welfare of the college and university bands and to  cultivate at large a wholesome respect for their activities and achievements. (2) To honor outstanding bandmembers through privilege of membership extended as a  reward for technical achievement and appreciation for the best in music. (3) To stimulate campus leadership and promulgate an uncompromising respect through  the medium of the college band for gracious conduct, good taste and unswerving loyalty. (4) To foster a close relationship between college bands and promote a high average of  attainment by the performance of good music and selection of worthwhile projects. (5) To provide a pleasant and helpful social experience for all engaged in college band  work and to cooperate with other musical organizations in any manner consistent with the  purposes of the institution at which chapters are located.

CREED We, the brothers of Kappa Kappa Psi, believe that service to the college or university  band program fosters responsibility, loyalty, and leadership; that a spirit of brotherhood  is enhanced by the participation in a band program; that music is a universal language  and truly the greatest of the arts; and that through fraternal participation, each member  will strive for the highest.

The service component of Kappa Kappa Psi is vital to the  very breadth of the organization. We exist in our current state due to  the service nature of the fraternity to the college and university band  programs.  BROTHERHOOD is part of a greater educational and service  activity devoted to strengthening the team and individual into the  best they can be. Our brotherhood requires optimism, enthusiasm,  and a cooperative spirit. Through chapter and district events, our  brotherhood grows and develops each year.  Since 1919, we have had a positive impact on over 200 colleges & universities nationally.

See Appendix D for KAPPA KAPPA PSI FAST FACTS

OFFICIAL FRATERNITY JEWELRY Membership Recognition Pin  –  A gold lapel pin of the  official crest or coat-of-arms, sometimes referred to as  the “Cofa.” Each of the symbols on the crest have a special  meaning to our members, their relationship to the Fraternity, and  the mission of our organization within your college or university  band. Become familiar with the Cofa of Kappa Kappa Psi so that  you can recognize it on sight. Fraternity members wear this pin as  a means of recognition signifying their continuing commitment  to the ideals of Brotherhood. Enameled Recognition Pin – A “colorized” version of  the Membership Recognition Pin, twice its size with  decorative enamel highlights. It is designed to be  worn on informal occasions. It is neither to be worn  alongside or instead of the ‘Cofa’ Pin or Crown Pearl  Badge, nor is it intended for Ritual or Chapter ceremonies. Crown Pearl Badge  –  The official means of identifying  oneself with the Fraternity. Unlike many other  organizations, purchase of the Crown Pearl Badge  is optional in Kappa Kappa Psi. The symbols of the badge have  special meaning to the members of the Fraternity, and it is worn  in the same manner as the recognition badges of other Greek- letter organizations:  over the heart, pinned to the shirt slightly  above the pocket, slightly towards the button-line. It is not to be  worn on sweatshirts, sports uniforms, or on the band uniform.  Appropriate attachments may be affixed to the badge, showing  both the Chapter’s Greek-letter designation and any offices held  by a members in the Chapter. Official Key  –  A gold key, inscribed with the most  significant of the Fraternity’s symbols. Originally  worn on a key or pocket-watch chain, in recent  years individual members have had it affixed to  tie-tack, tie-bars or pendant chains. It is often  given as a token of appreciation for special  services rendered, although it is available to the  general membership for their own use as an item  of personal jewelry if they so desire. Membership Candidate Pin  –  A lapel pin of blue and  silver, with symbols inscribed thereon that identify you  as a prospective member of the Fraternity. It is to be worn either  on the lapel of a suit or sports jacket or in the same manner  as the Crown Pearl Badge. Any exceptions for other occasions  or situations will be explained to you by your membership  education trainer. Recognition Bar –  A gold bar,  enameled in the Fraternity colors of  blue and white, which is designed for  wear on band uniforms, band jackets or sweaters. Only initiated 
members of the Fraternity are permitted its use and it is an  optional item of personal jewelry unless otherwise stated as the  accepted policy of your chapter. It is a means of identification  and should always be worn when visiting with other college or  university bands. By this fraternal sign, a Brother from another  active Chapter can make him/herself known to you, and your  own acquaintanceship with others having similar interest or  concerns will be increased. Life Member Pin  –  A gold circular pin with a blue  enameled border. On the border are the words  “Life Member.” In the center of the pin is the Kappa  Kappa Psi crest. Badge of Mourning – An official recognition ribbon worn in the  remembrance of brothers who have passed away. It consists of  fraternity regalia pinned through a black ribbon 5/8 inch wide  and two inches long. The Recognition Bar is pinned through the  full length of the ribbon, whereas the ribbon for all other regalia  is first folded in an inverted V-shape, then pinned through the  middle. The Badge is worn at the discretion of the Brotherhood. Fraternity Flag –  The Greek letters are  printed in an arc on the top half of the  flag with a white background. There are  three overlapping stars in the middle of  the flag and bottom of the flag over a blue  background. Fraternity Ring –  A gold or sterling silver solid band ring with  the Greek letters  ΚΚΨ  embossed on the face. Official Cheer – Two deep solo “K” in rapid succession followed by  the whole of the brotherhood replying “Psi” with voice inflection  rising. Official Colors –  Blue and White. Official Flower –  Red Carnation. Official Motto –  “Strive for the Highest.” The wearing of the Kappa Kappa Psi crest, symbols (with the  exception of the membership candidate pin) and/or letters  in any form, is limited to initiated members of the fraternity.  This restriction is lifted in the case of articles or regalia clearly  declaring, without abbreviation, the wearer as a membership  candidate or a colony member or denoting sponsorship or partial  sponsorship of an event by the Fraternity, provided said event is  not in conflict with the precepts and policies of Kappa Kappa Psi.



OUR SERVICE  MATTERS SUMMARY OF LESSON:  First Purpose Chapter History Band History Service Project Planning

“A true fraternity must have the principle of service embedded in its system - service that  exists not for the sake of formality, but service that comes from its members because they are  impelled and inspired to act in such a way; and service that extends beyond the fraternity  wall. “ - Harry Kugel, Alpha Chapter, Kappa Kappa Psi Baton, Vol. 4 May 1924, No. 1 pg.13 Part I: The First Purpose To promote the existence and welfare of the college and university bands and to  cultivate at large a wholesome respect for their activities and achievements.  On the local level, chapter responsibilities include numerous service projects as well as  providing the intangible items of morale, spirit, enthusiasm, atmosphere, and attitude  within the band. As noted in the Preamble of our National Constitution, the cultivation  and maintenance of an agreeable and enthusiastic attitude is mandatory for all our  members, and this serves to foster the wholesome and cooperative spirit that each  Director of Bands desires for their band. “The things you do for yourself are gone when you are gone, but the things you  do for others remain as your legacy.”  - Kalu Ndukwe Kalu

Part III: Service Project  Guidelines Membership Candidates will develop, plan and execute a service project that is to be  completed no later than the seventh week.  The Vice President of Membership will  provide the Membership Candidates with a list of possible service projects (see Service  Project Ideas in Appendix A).  The Director of Bands, Chapter Sponsor, and/or the  chapter officer in charge of service projects should be present at the meeting to help  guide the Membership Candidate class in the planning of this project. Service is a core value of Kappa Kappa Psi and a cornerstone of the National Brand.  It  is an integral part of the operation of your local chapter of Kappa Kappa Psi. Brothers  of Kappa Kappa Psi are often looking to identify a void in the band Program and fill  the void through their service, whether it is an everyday activity such as setting-up and  breaking down the band room before and after band rehearsals, or a major one-time  project, such as organizing the logistics for a band trip. Your Membership Candidate  class will work with the chapter officer who oversees service within your chapter to help  develop and execute this service project.

OUR LEADERSHIP  MATTERS SUMMARY OF LESSON:  Third Purpose Leadership as a Core Value of Kappa Kappa Psi Myths of Leadership Categories of Leaders Characteristics of a Great Brother and Leader Frat ernal Code of Conduct Situational Leadership Styles The Founders’ Circle

The Third Purpose To stimulate campus leadership and promulgate an uncompromising respect through  the medium of the college band, for gracious conduct, good taste, and unswerving  loyalty. Part I: QUALITIES OF  A GREAT LEADER Who comes to mind when you think of great leaders? What qualities make these  individuals stand apart from the others? The following is a list of common qualities  inherent in all great leaders. As Brothers of Kappa Kappa Psi, we can incorporate these  qualities into our leadership style and become more effective leaders. 1. Attitude : A positive attitude is the foundation of being a great leader. You must first  believe that you can be a leader in order to be successful. If you tell yourself that you  are going to fail, then you will. People tend to see things with their minds and not their  eyes. No matter what the situation, if you think it is negative, it becomes negative. To  avoid failure, you must first practice self-affirmation. Tell yourself that you will succeed  and repeat that message in your mind. Second, be optimistic. If something bad occurs,  learn from it, then let it go and focus on the positive. A positive attitude is the first, and  most important, step to becoming a great leader. 2. Interest in Learning from Others them. They seek to learn from others’ success. Great leaders do not become great alone,  but rather learn from many others. In turn, great leaders seek to create greatness in  others, both peers and those who will follow them. “Exemplary leaders know that if they want to gain commitment and achieve the highest  standards, they must be models of the behavior they expect of others.” - James M. Kouzes
: Great leaders are interested in the world around 

“Leadership is the art of getting others to do something you want  done because they want to do it.”  - President Dwight D. Eisenhower 3. Risk Taking : Great leaders dare to be different. They stretch the current parameters  in search of new ideas. Too often individuals are afraid to venture into the unknown  for fear of making mistakes. Great leaders take risks and learn from their experiences -  good or bad.  If they make a mistake, they take responsibility and decide immediately  what must be done to correct that mistake. Individuals without leadership qualities seek  to place blame on other people or on circumstances and therefore never truly learn. 4. Opportunity Seeking : Great leaders take the initiative to find and act upon  opportunities. They do not sit and wait for something to happen. Great leaders are  constantly looking for new avenues of success. 5. Goal Setting : Once an opportunity is discovered, great leaders set both long and  short-term goals to maximize that opportunity. The keys to setting obtainable goals  involve visualizing success, breaking the goal into smaller tasks, setting deadlines for the  accomplishment of those tasks, getting to work, and reviewing the goals. Great leaders  perform these keys constantly to ensure that no opportunity is left unused. 6. Empowering Others : Great leaders understand that to achieve their vision and  gain respect and authority, they must be willing to give power to others. They delegate  responsibility to other individuals and give those individuals the knowledge and  resources to succeed. When the great leader’s work is done the people around him/her  will say, “We did it ourselves!” “Leaders inspire a shared vision. They passionately believe that they can make a difference.  They envision the future, creating an ideal and unique image of what the organization can  become. Through their strong appeal and quiet persuasion, leaders enlist others in the  dream. They breathe life into visions and get us to see the exciting future possibilities.”  — From The Leadership Challenge, J. M. Kouzes and B. Z. Posner MEMBERSHIP CANDIDATE RESPONSE: What is Leadership? Why is it a core value of Kappa Kappa Psi?

What is Leadership? Why is it a core value of Kappa Kappa Psi?

PART II: MYTHS OF LEADERSHIP Myth: “Leaders are  Have you ever heard the statement, “He/She is a born leader”? While the statement  may be true in some circumstances, it also implies that if you were not born a leader you  may as well give up. This implication could not be further from the truth. Many of the  great leaders learned their skills by watching others. By identifying the characteristics  which set great leaders apart from average ones, we can all learn how to be successful  leaders. Myth: Leaders are  How many times have you thought all good leaders are charismatic? While this may be  true for some, most leaders are not. Charisma is the result of effective leadership and  not the cause. Those leaders who develop charisma will tend to receive more respect  from their followers, which in turn increases their ability to lead effectively. However,  charisma is not a prerequisite for effective leadership. Myth: Leadership exists only at the  This may be the leading myth about leadership and is also probably the most inaccurate.  Effective leadership does not begin and end with the officers. Leadership opportunities  exist everywhere for those willing to take advantage of them. Anyone who offers ideas  by which the Fraternity can evolve has contributed a measure of leadership. Those  willing to explore ideas, set goals, and achieve those goals are the most effective of  leaders. Myth: Effective leaders  This is perhaps the most damaging myth of all. Effective leadership is not so much the  exercise of power, but instead the empowerment of others. The great leaders achieve  their goals by motivating others to act. They lead by pulling instead of pushing; by  inspiring instead of ordering; and by enabling others to use their own abilities instead  of denying or constraining individuals.

PART III: Characteristics of  a Great Brother  and Leader Brothers of Kappa Kappa Psi are looked to as role models and leaders by other  members in the band and on campus. We can never know who is watching our  actions or who will be affected by our deeds. It is therefore essential that we present  positive qualities at all time. Being a Brother is not a part time commitment. As such,  the example we set should shine constantly to inspire others. The following qualities  define Brothers of Kappa Kappa Psi. These qualities described Bohumil Makovsky,  our Guiding Spirit. By following Boh’s example, we will teach and inspire others as he  taught and inspired our Founding Fathers. FRATERNAL CODE OF CONDUCT: Honor  -  Brothers should conduct themselves with honor at all times. Our service to  college and university bands serves as an example to others. We should take pride in  these accomplishments and not let anything tarnish our honorable reputation. Integrity  -  The character of our Brotherhood is based upon the principles of decency  and sincerity. Our impeccable integrity lets others know we can always be trusted to  keep our word. Respect  -  Respect for others is a cornerstone of Kappa Kappa Psi. Our diverse  membership is an asset that cannot be taken for granted. Using this strength to our  advantage requires respect for others and their points of view. In return, we earn the  respect from others by treating them as equals. Loyalty  -  Service to band programs and the Fraternity requires people who are devoted  to those organizations. Working together is the key to achieving our goals. Being loyal  and dependable is therefore essential to our success.

MEMBERSHIP CANDIDATE RESPONSE:  Which part of the Code of Conduct do you relate to the most? Why? MEMBERSHIP CANDIDATE RESPONSE:  How does failure affect leadership? What role should the Code of Conduct play in defining  your response to failure and other adversity?

PART IV: THE FOUNDERS’ CIRCLE Theoretically, material for The Founders’ Circle is based primarily on the Social Change  Model of leadership. This model was developed in 1993 by a group of researchers led by  Helen and Alexander Astin at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Their  model identifies three (3) different levels of leadership: Individual, Group/Team, and  Society/Community. We borrow these levels directly from the Social Change Model  and use specific Founding Fathers to illustrate each. William A. Scroggs represents the  Individual Level, which focuses on core principles and values for each leader to identify  and develop. The Group/Team Level is captured by A. Frank Martin, whose work as  National Executive Secretary was essential toward the evolution of Kappa Kappa Psi.  Finally, Bohumil Makovsky represents the Society/Community Level. As the Guiding  Spirit of our Fraternity, Boh perfectly captures the vision that exemplary leaders must  have to inspire others toward great achievements.  In addition to this primary framework from the Social Change Model, The Founders’  Circle incorporates specific skills and values that survey respondents (both students  and college band directors) identified to the Leadership Task Force in 2013. These  competencies are categorized into the three levels (individual, group/team, society/ community) and provide individuals with a comprehensive understanding of leadership.  https://www.kkpsi.org/founderscircle/ WILLIAM A. SCROGGS – THE INDIVIDUAL LEADER (LEVEL 1)  The primary focus of this level is for individuals to develop a better understanding of  themselves. This includes learning about their specific strengths and weaknesses within  their own personalities. A FRANK MARTIN – THE GROUP/TEAM LEADER (LEVEL 2)  The primary focus of this level is for individuals to develop skills and abilities that allow  them to interact with small groups and teams. These include incorporating diversity  within teams, fostering a collaborative environment and resolving conflict. BOHUMIL MAKOVSKY – THE VISIONARY LEADER (LEVEL 3)  The primary focus of this level is for individuals to develop skills and abilities that allow  them to become visionary leaders capable of transforming large groups of individuals  and/or society. These skills include developing and communicating a vision and  becoming a change agent.

Part I: Why Music? Musicianship is a core value and part of the national brand of Kappa Kappa Psi. We  bring to Kappa Kappa Psi our individual talent and technical achievement as musicians  and band members. Often,  musicianship only focuses on our participation in a band  ensemble or the level of our performance at a concert or event. Members should  appreciate music and musical expression in all forms, and we should be dedicated to  excellence in performance. Musicianship is also about the relationships you build with  your fellow band members, directors, and community.  Musicianship is a lifestyle and a call to charity, kindness, and compassion. It is an  expression of the best of who we are as Brothers. MUSICIANSHIP IN OUR PURPOSES SECOND PURPOSE To honor outstanding band members through privilege of membership, extended as  a reward for technical achievement and appreciation for the best in music. “...Music is a universal language and truly the greatest of the arts…”  - Kappa Kappa Psi Creed “Where words fail, music speaks.”  - Hans Christian Andersen

THE NATIONAL INTERCOLLEGIATE BAND One of the most exciting contributions made to the work of  collegiate music during the last half-century has been the National  Intercollegiate Band program of Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta  Sigma.  The NIB was founded in 1947 by Dr. F. Lee Bowling. Dr. F. Lee Bowling was Kappa Kappa Psi Grand President from  1941-1947. The NIB was his cherished idea and through the years he  worked to develop a plan that firmly established the organization as a national service  project for the Fraternity and Sorority.

THE W. FRANCIS MCBETH STUDENT MUSICIANSHIP AWARD Created at the 2011 National Convention in Colorado Springs, the W. Francis McBeth  Student Musicianship Award honors current active, associate, and conditional members  of Kappa Kappa Psi that exemplify the highest standards of Musical Achievement.  McBeth served as the commissioning composer for the 1971 National Intercollegiate  Band.  The first recipient of the award was Zachary Friedland from Theta Upsilon at  the University of Rhode Island. THE NATIONAL COMMISSIONING PROGRAM The commissioning program of Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma has made a  significant impact on band music in America. This joint program was conceived by  Kappa Kappa Psi Grand President Hugh E. McMillen. He felt the organizations  should offer something constructive to college and university bands. He saw in the  National Intercollegiate Band the perfect vehicle for a lasting contribution to the field  of wind band literature.

IMPORTANCE OF MUSIC IN OUR UNIVERSITIES  - JOHN PHILIP SOUSA This article was written exclusively for the BATON, April 30, 1923 It would be interesting historical data to locate the days of emancipation of the various  professions from the thralldom of feudalism. We know the old masters of literature  used as their comic characters those professions that were held in derision by the public  at large. Thickheaded asininity, or, to modernize it, dumbbell perception is shown in  its fullest play in the Shakespearean character of “Dogberry” and he was of the law.  Moliere and other writers of those times found great fun in exploiting characters  of doctors and medical men in general. While the musician has not been a subject  of laughter, he is almost the last, if not the last of the professional men to become  emancipated and to stand out as a distinct class in the world’s community.  It is within the memory of the writer the almost best steady position a musician could  hope for was one in a theatrical orchestra where his salary was a mere pittance, and this  was not confined to the tyros of the professional, but the students of their art and fine  exponents on their instruments. Today that is all changed, and the musician has come  into his own. In symphony orchestras and concert bands, he is not paid according to the  union scale unless he is among the poorest players in the organization. Every particle of  ability above the common standard of his union enables him to demand an increase in  salary, and it is making the profession one of the most desirable in the world.  One of the greatest factors in the emancipation of the musical profession has been  the interest manifested by the great universities in musical culture and in making it a  part of the curriculum of their institutions. The amount of money invested in musical  enterprises today is enormous and the demand for the most perfect performance  is insistent and it is my belief that each year will see a higher regard paid to the  development of musical talent in our colleges and universities.

Taken from the Baton, 1923, pg. 32: Who Will Furnish The Music? Come, brothers all, a toast we’ll sing To the frat we love so well. Kappa Kappa Psi, thy glorious strains Fore’er within us swell. Harmony, in thought and deed, For this we labor long. Harmony, with melody, To cheer the world along. Thy music charms; thy lyre sings Of rich fraternal love. Thy baton moves; the weling rings, Sweet echoes from above. One common aim: we always strive The highest to attain. Through work and faith, in brotherhood, Perfection we shall gain. Achievement in perfection soul. For this we live and die. The faith that wins we’ll seek and find In Kappa Kappa Psi. -JOHN LONERGAN

Part III:  BOHUMIL MAKOVSKY Guiding Spirit of Kappa Kappa Psi | Director of Bands & Head of  the Music Department Oklahoma Agricultural & Mechanical College An immigrant from Bohemia, Boh Makovsky arrived in the United  States with next to nothing, but became one of the premier band  directors in the country. His personal ambition, as he started his  career, is what carried him through his early struggles and failures. Although Bohumil Makovsky lacked a formal music education,  his experiences as a professional musician and conductor led Boh  to become a music educator with strong ideas on how to teach  music and direct bands. As a director, he was said to have had an  “immaculate” rehearsal technique, often working difficult passages  over and over until he achieved what he felt was the maximum  level of perfection. He stressed tone and balance throughout the  ensemble in order to achieve a truly symphonic sound, stressing the  second and third parts for dark coloring. As a member of one of Boh’s bands, you were expected to adhere  to the strict discipline he imposed and to show respect for the  ensemble. To quote Paul Enix: “He was a stickler for attendance, being there, being on time with your  parts prepared. You showed the respect to him of not talking or doing anything distracting during the  course of the rehearsal. It was very business-like. He instilled that business-like attitude. You knew  what was expected of you, and you prepared in order to make the rehearsal come off that way.”

OUR BROTHERHOOD  MATTERS SUMMARY OF LESSON:  Fraternity History Founding Fathers National Headquarters, National Shrine, and Caboose Definition of Brotherhood Fifth Purpose

“There is a destiny which makes us Brothers; none goes his way alone. All that we send into  the lives of others comes back into our own.”  - Edwin Markham “Friendship must be growing greater continually.  It must go up continually, otherwise your  friendship is going down”  - William A. Scroggs, September 1923, The Baton pg. 60 Part I: To provide a pleasant and helpful social experience for all engaged  in college band work and to cooperate with other musical  organizations in any manner consistent with the purposes of the  institution at which chapters are located. MEMBERSHIP CANDIDATE RESPONSE:  How does the 5th purpose connect to the core value of Brotherhood?
Fifth Purpose 

“The crest and crowning of all good, Life’s final star, is Brotherhood.” Part II: The  Founding of Kappa Kappa Psi In the years that followed World War I, a movement developed among college and  university bands, searching for some motivating force that would create a greater  interest in band music. This movement sought expression in an effort to develop  good will, fellowship, and understanding among bands and their members and to  recognize the value of dedicated leadership. Seizing upon this idea in the fall of 1919,  a member of the band at Oklahoma A&M College (later to be known as Oklahoma  State University) conceived the idea that something should be done to bring together  the bandsmen in our colleges and universities. At that time there were a few national  organizations for professional musicians, but none exclusively for college and university  bandsmen. It was with this in mind that this member confided in Mr. A. Frank  Martin, giving his plans for organizing a National Band Fraternity. Mr. Martin, then  President of the Band, was very  enthusiastic over the proposition.  Knowing that Professor  Bohumil Makovsky strongly  supported anything that fosters  the development of better music,  William A. Scroggs, founder  of the Fraternity, went to  “Boh” with his proposition. Mr.  Makovsky at once saw the great  possibilities of such a fraternity  and offered his undivided  support to the cause.  Mr. Scroggs immediately  arranged for a secret conference  with Professor Makovsky  and A. Frank Martin. At this 
 History 
- Edwin Markham

conference ten of the best men of the Oklahoma A&M College Band, who were not  only leaders in the band but in their respective schools, in their fraternities, and in  scholastic activities, were selected as charter members. The ten men selected to work  out the intricate problems of the new organization were: A. Frank Martin, William  A. Scroggs, Raymond D. Shannon, Carl A. Stevens, Clyde Haston, Clayton E. Soule,  William H. Coppedge, Asher Hendrickson, Dick Hurst, and Iron Hawthorne Nelson. A meeting was immediately called and the first officers of the Fraternity were elected.  William Scroggs was unanimously elected to be the first President of the new  organization; A. Frank Martin, Vice President; Clayton Soule, Secretary and William Coppedge, Sergeant of Arms. Committees were elected as follows:  Constitution and By Nelson; Ritual – A. Frank Martin, Clayton Soule, and Col. F. D. Wickham; Fraternity  Pin Design and Coat of Arms –William Coppedge, Clyde Haston, and Dick Hurst;  Degree Oaths –William Coppedge, A. Frank Martin, and Asher Hendrickson. With the local organization complete, a corporation was formed which petitioned the  Oklahoma Corporation Commission for a charter. The charter was granted November  27, 1919; and “Kappa Kappa Psi, National Fraternity for College Bandsmen,” was  established on the Oklahoma A&M College campus with the local group being known  as “The Alpha Chapter.” When this young organization started working on their plans for organizing a  National Fraternity, they were confronted with many difficulties. However, these  charter members knew not the meaning of defeat but went forward with all the more  determination. Knowing that petitions would soon be received asking for charters,  the first National Officers were elected from the ten charter members to take care of  the national workings of the Fraternity. The men that received this honor of being the  first National Officers were: Grand President, A. Frank Martin; First Vice President,  Raymond Shannon; Second Vice President, Clyde Haston; Secretary, Clayton Soule;  Treasurer, Carl A. Stevens; and Editor and Assistant Secretary, William A. Scroggs. During the first year of operation as an honorary society, the members were kept busy  working out and adopting a national constitution, creating and developing the Ritual  ceremony, designing the jewelry needed to provide distinctive recognition for the  organization, and setting up plans for the expansion of the Fraternity.

Jones, who was on the faculty of the Chemistry Department, suggested the Greek name  and symbols, “Kappa Kappa Psi,” which was adopted by the Charter Members and has  stood symbolical of the ideals of the Fraternity ever since. With the help of Colonel  F.D. Wickham, who was Commandant of the R.O.T.C. at the College, the Committee  on Ritual conceived perfect customs for the Ritual. A. Frank Martin is considered the  author of the Ritual of Kappa Kappa Psi and very few revisions of his basic ideas have  been made. Work on the First Degree was soon completed, and five more leading members of  the band were selected as the Charter candidates of the fraternity. They were Gilbert  Isenberg, Herbert Dixon, Dean Dale, Carl Smelzer, and Clarence Shaw. These men  were selected to test out the ritual work, as each degree was completed. Seeing the success of the first attempt, the members were inspired to put forth even  greater for the betterment of this great organization. Letters were sent out to ten  colleges and universities throughout the country, telling of the new organization. Five  replies were received, all of which expressed their approval of such an organization and  the great possibilities of its future. In the spring of 1920 a petition was received from  the University of Washington in Seattle, which was accepted. The college year closed  and very little was done until the opening of college in the fall.

Later that next fall a petition was received and duly accepted from the Montana State  College, (later to be known as Montana State University), in Bozeman, Montana. As  all Ritual work had been completed as well as the constitution and bylaws, Raymond  Shannon and William Scroggs were sent to the two petitioning institutions and Kappa  Kappa Psi reached out her hand of fraternal spirit and cooperation to Washington and  Montana. The bands of both institutions are the pride of their states and ranked high  with any in the United States. In the spring of 1921, a petition was received from a university within Oklahoma.  A charter was granted and eight members of the mother chapter went to Norman,  Oklahoma, and installed a chapter of an organization that is doing more to create the  right spirit between the two leading state institutions of Oklahoma than is possible  through any other procedure. The Fall of 1921 found the fraternity on a firm foundation and every member in an  optimistic attitude. Institutions from the North, South, East, and West were writing  in for information and the necessary contents required in petitions. The officers were  busy perfecting the internal mechanism of the Fraternity. Every member was eagerly  looking to the First National Convention of the Fraternity and all the details which  would lay the foundation for a successful convention.  This Convention was held at the  home of the Mother Chapter, Oklahoma A&M College in Stillwater, Oklahoma, on  January 2, 1922, and from the spirit shown by the delegates and officers, the great future  of Kappa Kappa Psi was realized and insured. Scott P. Squyers, from the Delta Chapter  at University of Oklahoma, was elected to the highest honor of the Fraternity – Grand  President. Other National officers elected were: W. A. Nelson of the University of  Washington – First Vice President; John Wylie, Jr. of Montana State College – Second  National Vice President; Dick Hurst – National Secretary; Asher Hendrickson –  National Treasurer; and William A. Scroggs – National Editor and Assistant Secretary,  were from Oklahoma A&M College. Professor Bohumil Makovsky became the first National Honorary Member of Kappa  Kappa Psi and soon after the close of the First National Convention, John Philip Sousa  accepted the invitation to become a National Honorary member of Kappa Kappa Psi.  He expressed his appreciation of the honor given him during the evening: “Brothers,  I have received medals and honors from every civilized country, but I feel this honor  above all, due to the fact that this was given to me by a group of University bandsmen 

who are furthering the great work that I have dedicated my whole life to.” Since the beginning, the Fraternity has enjoyed steady growth. At present the Fraternity  is serving over 200 college and university band programs with over 5,000 active  members. 3 things I learned from this article: 2 connections made to this article: 1 question still lingering after reading the article:

Part III: Headquarters Kappa Kappa Psi  & Tau Beta Sigma For many years, the National Headquarters of Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta  Sigma was located in the Seretean Center for the Performing Arts on the campus of  Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, Oklahoma. In November 1991, the National  Headquarters moved from the Seretean  Center to Stillwater Station. Stillwater  Station, a former Santa Fe Railway  Depot, was purchased by the Fraternity  and Sorority from a group of five  Stillwater citizens who had bought the  station at auction in order to insure that  it be preserved. Three of these men are  alumni of the Alpha Chapter of Kappa  Kappa Psi. The original plans for Stillwater Station  are dated June 15, 1911. Construction of  Stillwater Station was completed in 1917 with a formal dedication ceremony in 1918.  Stillwater Station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places by the United  States Department of the Interior, National Park Service, on March 3, 1980. Stillwater Station provides Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma with office space, a  conference room, work room, storage space, and the National Archives. The purpose of  the National Headquarters is to coordinate the activities of the Chapters and Colonies  of Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma and to serve the needs of Active members 
 The National 
 of 

from across the nation. The National Headquarters is the link between these chapters  and colonies and a source of continuity for the two organizations. The services of the National Headquarters fall into  four categories, all of which overlap: Administrative  Services, Fiscal Management, Record Keeping, and  Publicity and Promotion.  The staff of the National  Headquarters is accountable to the National Councils  and Boards of Trustees of each organization, and  through them, to the National Chapter. In April 2021, the National Headquarters acquired  more office space in the way of The Annex.  The Annex is located at 215 E 9th Avenue, just two blocks west of the National  Headquarters.  A quick 3-4 minute walk door-to-door. The Annex not only meets  the needs of the organizations for years to come, it was much less expensive than any  options that included renovation or expansion of the Stillwater Station. The Stillwater  Station and the Annex are great assets that will greatly serve the membership of both  organizations, our chapters, our alumni and the band programs that we serve! THE CABOOSE The Caboose was moved to our National  Headquarters at Stillwater Station in 2006  to be used as a ‘living museum”, archive/ research study and display/museum for  the Fraternity’s historical artifacts.  The  purchase and renovation of the Caboose  was made possible by a gift from Mr. and  Mrs. Al and Gladys Wright, as well as  Brothers and Chapters of Kappa Kappa  Psi.

THE NATIONAL SHRINE OF  KAPPA KAPPA PSI The National Shrine of Kappa Kappa Psi  Fraternity is located on the campus of  Oklahoma State University in a prominent  position immediately west of the Classroom  Building. Shaped as an irregular shaft a little  over four feet in height, the Shrine is made  of native Oklahoma pink granite. On its  sloping polished top is a bronze plaque, and  the three Greek letters, “Kappa,” “Kappa,”  “Psi.”  The raised-letter inscription on the  plaque reads as follows: “Kappa Kappa  Psi, National Honorary Band Fraternity,  Founded at Oklahoma State University,  1919” and “Tau Beta Sigma National  Honorary Band Sorority, Founded 1946”.  The National Shrine was formally dedicated  on March 26, 1960. Kappa Kappa Psi celebrated its Centennial  on Saturday, July 20, 2019 at the end of  the 2019 National Convention.  There  was a celebration in honor of our Founder,  Charter Members and Bohumil Makovsky.  In honor of the fraternity’s Centennial  we added a new marker which states  the following, “Here we rededicate  this monument to the past and present  brothers of Kappa Kappa Psi Honorary  Band Fraternity on its Centennial in  2019.”  This message sits alongside the  official Centennial logo designed by our  Publications Manager & Multimedia  Designer Robert Bratcher, Life Member of  the Iota Zeta chapter.

Part IV:  Toward  a Definition of  Brotherhood By John Shertzer,  Fraternal Thoughts “What is brotherhood?  I’ve often found that it’s a difficult concept to put into words.   The dictionary just can’t seem to do it justice.  The same with sisterhood.   A common  answer I heard during rush was:  “it’s just something you have to experience to  understand.”  I probably said that to recruits as well as I’ve moved along in my fraternity  journey, I think it’s becoming easier for me to define. Brotherhood is not as vague and  intangible as it once was for me.  At this point, if someone were to ask me to define  brotherhood in the fraternity sense, this would be my reply:  BROTHERHOOD IS THE BONDING OF PEOPLE OF VARIOUS  BACKGROUNDS, BELIEFS, PLACES, AND ERAS AROUND A  SINGULAR SET OF LIFE-DIRECTING COMMITMENTS. This is what allows me to share brotherhood with the people I graduated with, and  with those who graduated a century ago.  It allows me to be a brother with someone I  disagree with politically, religiously, or in any other way.  Because instead of being based  on personalities and friendship, brotherhood is based on shared commitments. A brotherhood is weak or strong based on the degree to which the commitments are  made and maintained. A brother is a good brother if he/she follows the commitments  and helps others follow them as well.  How do I know if the recruitment chair’s claim  of the “strongest brotherhood on campus” is true?  Or even partially true?  By how  much the brothers know, stay true and hold each other true to those commitments. Brotherhood has to be maintained. Constantly. For the rest of your life.  If you choose  to stop adhering to the commitments you made, then you fall out of the brotherhood.   You stop being a brother, even if you’re wearing the letters or your name still appears in  the directory. If a fraternity values togetherness and hanging out, then it is really valuing friendship. 

This is completely fine. Friendship is an attractive asset for a fraternity. It’s also  an attractive asset for a residence hall floor.  Lots of places can claim friendship.  Brotherhood is not friendship, although it can create friendship.  Brotherhood is a  sacred privilege.  It’s not easy to maintain.  Brotherhood is unique enough that it is  found sparingly.    Why is brotherhood difficult to define?  Because done right, it is extraordinary.  There is  a reason so many brothers stand up at each others’ weddings.  And eventually eulogize  each other. Those moments are reserved for family, or those who might as well be.  For  those with whom we’ve forged a connection that’s deeper than just beers on Saturday  nights, or Spring Break trips together.  A connection born on the day we spoke the  oaths that made us fraternity men together. Those oaths made us brothers.  And for  as long as we pledge to stay true to those oaths, and help each other stay true as well,  brothers is what we’ll remain.” - From  “As Brothers of Kappa Kappa Psi, we should demonstrate the following qualities: outstanding  musicianship, leadership, positive attitude, integrity, dedication, good work ethic.  Failure  is learning. Learning doesn’t take place in the absence of mistakes. The goal is not to promote  failure, but to recognize that it is a part of the process. Your mistakes do not define you; they  are preparing and developing you for your future success.  Love is the soul of Leadership and  Brotherhood. Love must be at the center of our work for each other and bands. As leaders, we  must be in love with leading others and focusing on what is best for them. As brothers we must  be in love with band and music. We must be prepared to make a positive impact on our bands  and the people around us.  We must be brothers and leaders that listen to understand, not reply.  We must show our appreciation to each other, and celebrate excellence and success. If we aren’t  surrounded by people who also believe this, we will look for the nearest exit. Leaders and  Brothers work side by side to make great things happen for their chapter and band.  We are  meant to live in harmony with our fellow Brothers.” - The Baton

SEE APPENDIX G FOR OTHER MEMBERSHIP STATUSES

Part II:  District  THE NATIONAL CHAPTER Overview The national organizations of Kappa Kappa Psi Fraternity and Tau Beta Sigma Sorority  host a biennial National Convention. At this convention, new National Officers are  elected to govern the two fraternal groups, the National Constitutions are revised, and  new awards and programs are created. The National Convention is planned by the  National Councils and the National Executive Director. Each biennium, the location of  the National Convention rotates through a regional system of Districts. One or more  chapters within the given district will be selected to help host the event. The current Districts are named according to their geographic location within the U.S.  and include an International District. Each District is governed by an elected corps of  officers; each District also has appointed advisors, known as Governors within Kappa  Kappa Psi and Counselors within Tau Beta Sigma.  Districts allow local chapters in a region to develop a closer relationship fostered  through various District functions and an annual convention. Hosted by chapters  within the District, these conventions allow chapters to generate programs and policies.  Often, the ideas that are shared at District Conventions are then discussed on a  national level. In 1987, the Districts were realigned from the original ten numbered areas to seven.  This was done in order to better facilitate District meetings and eliminate those  Districts having only one or two active Chapters.

CHAPTER FIELD REPRESENTATIVE PROGRAM The National Chapter Field Representative Program began in 1992. The program was  created to provide a direct link between chapters and the National Leadership Team.  The Chapter Field Representatives (CFRs) serve a two-year term as both a member of  the National Headquarters Staff as well as a member of the National Leadership Team.  In 2006, the program expanded from one CFR to two to accommodate the needs of the  growing fraternity. The primary job of a CFR is to visit chapters and petitioning groups across the country.  When the CFRs are not traveling, they assist the Headquarters Staff in Stillwater,  Oklahoma. The purpose of a CFR visit is to facilitate discussion on areas of growth  for the chapter, assist the chapter with goal setting, and to inform chapters about the  resources available to them. Chapter visits also allow CFRs to identify trends across  districts and chapters. This information is valuable for the National Leadership Team to  use to determine if new resources are needed for chapters to be successful. CFRs can assist chapters with all aspects of chapter operations. If you or your chapter  have a question and are unsure of who to reach out to, please contact a CFR for  assistance. kkycfr@kkpsi.org

The Motto of Kappa Kappa Psi is: ________________________________________. MEMBERSHIP CANDIDATE RESPONSE:  What attributes, qualities, and actions makes a good active member of Kappa Kappa Psi?

“Better bands, Better Music, More Fraternity - Makes the Bonds of Brotherhood  Grow Stronger.”  - Scott P. Squires, Grand President Kappa Kappa Psi, The Baton, Vol. 2, March 1923, No. 1, pg. 5 Before you can inspire with emotion, you must be swamped with it yourself.  Before  you can move their tears, your own must flow. To convince them, you must yourself believe.” -Winston Churchill Kappa Kappa Psi  Alumni Association The Kappa Kappa Psi Alumni Association is dedicated to supporting the Fraternity.  Recognizing that the college band experience should continue after graduation, the  National Alumni Program will focus its efforts on connecting and enriching members  from the past, present, and future of college and university bands; promoting lifelong  involvement with band; and enhancing the long-term growth and financial viability of  Kappa Kappa Psi. The Kappa Kappa Psi Alumni Association is an opportunity for members to extend  their fraternity activity by participating as alumni Brothers and is open to all alumni,  life, and honorary members of the Fraternity. Members of the Alumni Association help  offset costs of the Alumni Program, while annual dues and donations support alumni  activities to ensure the Fraternity’s continued ability to provide valuable experiences for  all members following graduation. The Alumni Association is administered by the Kappa Kappa Psi Alumni Board of  Directors (AABOD). While members of the Alumni Association do not conduct  business meetings as an assembled body, the Board of Directors discusses Alumni  Association activities, directions, and goals with association members at conventions  and other meetings to plan future alumni programs and events.

Life Membership Life membership shall be granted to any Alumni member upon payment of a Life  Membership contribution, the amount to be set by the National Chapter, along with an  application to the National Headquarters.

Appendix H Brother Interview Guidelines The Purpose of the Brother Interview The purpose of the Brother Interview is to connect Membership Candidates to the Active Members  of the local chapter of Kappa Kappa Psi. This setting provides dialogue and a deeper level of fellowship  that acquaints Membership Candidates and Active Members alike with the quality and character of  each individual. Stipulations for Interviews • The interview is best done in a public place, such as a local coffee shop, an on campus dining facility,  or your favorite public place on campus. Please do not put yourself in a situation at someone’s home or  apartment. • The interview should not run over an hour and should take place between normal university class  operating hours. Interviews can take place on the weekend, as long as they stay within the normal  university class operating hours. • The interview needs to be a conversation between the Brother and Membership Candidate. • Interviews should be planned and scheduled ahead of time, and should not be a surprise to the  Membership Candidate or Brother. • Brothers should conduct themselves in a manner consistent with the values of the fraternity and  policies of the educational institution. • No interviews with other musical organizations or conditional members. • No individual alumni interviews - panel interviews only.   Interview Options for Small Chapters (1-20 Brothers) • The Membership Candidates have the ability to interview every Brother in a small chapter. • The VPM may also choose to use one or more of the alternatives for interviews listed below.  For  especially small chapters, the use of group and social events can help bring the chapter together. Interview Options for Large Chapters (20 or more Brothers) • Each week during the Class meeting, set aside time for a class interview. A different past  membership Class will be assigned to come in each week, and the Class of Active Brothers will spend  this designated time during the Class meeting to have a Class-to-Class interview for no longer than  one hour. This should be conducted more as a casual conversation in a group, rather than formal one- on-one interviews. • It is NOT feasible or appropriate for Membership Candidates to conduct one-on-one interviews  with each active Brother. • The VPM may also choose to use one or more of the alternatives for interviews listed below. Alternatives for Interviews: • Kappa Kappa Psi Speed Dating  • Group activities or a social event where the Membership Candidate class and the chapter (or a  portion of the chapter) is at an event.

• Potluck Dinner - both Brothers and Membership Candidates bring a dish and socialize together. • Kappa Kappa Psi Bingo Card Interview “Do’s and Dont’s”: For Brothers • Do be approachable for Membership Candidates. • Do reach out to Membership Candidates that you may have not yet met. Remember that these  MC’s are joining Kappa Kappa Psi, an organization you are a part of already. It may be more difficult  for Membership Candidates to reach out and schedule a meeting, due to not yet feeling comfortable  with reaching out to Active Members.  • Do suggest a meeting place that may be a favorite spot of yours, or explore new options around  town.  • Do keep the meeting place public; this is for the safety and protection of both individuals involved  in the meeting.  • Do not “grill” or expect Membership Candidates to repeat, perform, memorize, or recite  information. The “Road to Wisdom” Program is meant to build upon the strengths and foundation the  Membership Candidate already possesses.  • Do not task Membership Candidates with projects. Interviews are a time to build relationships.  For Membership Candidates • Do request Brothers to meet with you in a place that both parties feel comfortable.  • Do not wait until the last week prior to initiation to complete interviews with the Active Members.  Class Interview Option In an effort for Membership Candidates to transition from acquaintances to Brothers, Membership  Candidates will interview Active Brothers during weekly interview sessions by way of Class  interviews.  Interviews provide both Actives and Membership Candidates with a structured,  yet informal, setting that provides dialogue and a deeper level of friendship through knowledge.  Membership Candidates will interview all Active Brothers of the chapter through Class interviews. Interview pages should still be made for Brother Class interviews. An interview page should be  made for each past membership Class, including questions for the Class as a whole and questions for  individual Brothers in the Class. It is the responsibility of the membership committee to teach Membership Candidates and Actives  alike as to how interviews shall be set up and conducted. Ten questions are the minimum to comprise  a satisfactory interview. These questions will aim at providing insight as to the quality and character  each Active member possesses. The questions are subject to an approval by the membership educators,  and will be evaluated on educational and personal value. Setting up additional meeting time is the responsibility of the Membership Candidates and desired  Actives. These times must be reasonable to all parties. It is not required, but is strongly recommended.  During interviews, Actives are encouraged to be themselves. Actives shall also interview the

Appendix I Tau Beta Sigma National History A Brief History of Tau Beta Sigma The following excerpt from The Baton, forerunner of The Podium, describes the origins of Tau Beta  Sigma. However, this was not the first time a Band Sorority was mentioned in Kappa Kappa Psi  chronicles. During the winter and spring of 1940, the young ladies of the Texas Tech Band were not satisfied to be left  out in the cold while the Kappa Kappa Psi men were busily engaged in aiding the band. They went into  action and organized a band sorority…. They named the organization ‘Tau Beta Sigma’ and ad-opted a constitution which called for formal pledging  and initiation ritual. They have their pin designed for members and pledges, a coat of arms, sorority crest,  and all of the necessary arrangements for a complete organization. They meet on Monday nights, the same as  the Kappa Kappa Psi men, and continue to operate through the school year of 1941-42. New officers for the  coming year have been elected and the sorority has expressed a keen desire to become affiliated as an auxiliary  unit with Kappa Kappa Psi….  In the early years of the fraternity most college bands were entirely male, and prior to the early 1970s  Kappa Kappa Psi was an all-male organization. Women started to join college bands before World  War II, but there was no organization available to them similar to Kappa Kappa Psi. In 1937, the first practical idea for establishing an organization for band women was presented to  D. O. Wiley, Director of the Texas Tech University Band. A member of the band, Wava Banes (now  Wava Banes Henry of Midway, Utah), along with her classmates, Emily Surell and Rosell Williams,  discussed many of the possibilities and requirements necessary for the formation of a National Band  Sorority. Their plans came to fruition in 1939, when a group of women in the Tech Band founded a  local organization, known as “Tau Beta Sigma,” modeled both in principle and idealism after Kappa  Kappa Psi. Just like the Fraternity,  recognition society, but one to provide special social and educational experiences useful to women in  the “all male world” of collegiate bands. Unfortunately, just as the group was becoming well established, World War II disrupted plans to make  the Sorority a truly national organization. However,  projects within the band program and assuming much of the responsibility for keeping the Tech Band  in operation during the war years. In June of 1943, the Tech women petitioned the Grand Council of Kappa Kappa Psi to become a part  of the National Fraternity as an active chapter. Accepting the group under these conditions would  have entailed a complete revision of the Fraternity’s constitution, an impossibility under wartime

conditions when all Fraternity operations were virtually suspended. Accordingly, it was suggested  that Tau Beta Sigma incorporate as its own national organization, but the legal requirements of the  State of Texas precluded this. In 1945, A. Frank Martin, Executive Secretary of Kappa Kappa Psi,  was invited to meet with the women and assist them in designing a plan to gain national status.  During the meeting, it was determined fewer obstacles would be encountered by submitting a charter  application for the national organization in the State of Oklahoma. In order to establish the national  organization, the women of the Texas Tech Tau Beta Sigma Band Sorority surrendered their name,  Chapter Constitution, Ritual, and jewelry designs to the band club at Oklahoma State University.  On March 26, 1946, a corporate charter was granted to Tau Beta Sigma by the State of Oklahoma.  The Kappa Kappa Psi delegates at the 1947 Fraternity Convention officially voted to accept Tau  Beta Sigma as a “sister organization” of the Fraternity and offered this new organization the privilege  of sharing all fraternal publications, National Office operations, staff personnel, and other fraternal  programs.  Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma have shared a National Headquarters since 1947.   For many years, the National Headquarters of Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma was located in  the Seretean Center for Performing Arts on the campus of Oklahoma State University in Stillwater,  Oklahoma.  In November of 1991, the National Headquarters of Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta  Sigma moved to Stillwater Station, in Stillwater, Oklahoma, which is listed in the National Register  of Historic Places. Tau Beta Sigma Today One of the landmark contributions Tau Beta Sigma made to the world of college and university bands  was the creation of a national award designed to honor women for outstanding service to music. The  Outstanding Service to Music Award was  presented in 1969 to Barbara Buehlman, music educator,  composer, and executive administrator of the Mid-West Band and Orchestra Clinic. The Silver Anniversary of Tau Beta Sigma was celebrated at the 1971 National Convention. The  concert march, Tau Beta Sigma, by Donald I. Moore, was commissioned to commemorate the  founding of the Sorority. During the 1970s, Tau Beta Sigma continued to grow. Participation and service at the local, district,  and national levels helped to improve the lines of communication between the National Council  and the Active membership. In 1977, all former membership restrictions were removed and chapters  were a provided the opportunity to initiate male members of the band. In addition, the national  fee structure was aligned and all former debts of the Sorority were eliminated. The Gamma Kappa  Chapter at the University of Connecticut was the first coed chapter by more than one year. Considerable membership growth and colonization in the early 1980s sparked the Sorority to re- evaluate its programs and goals. There was a need to achieve a balance between the support services for  chapters and colonies and public relations within the music profession. During the 1980s, Tau Beta Sigma adopted national policies on hazing and alcohol. The geographical  districts were restructured and renamed, and the Ritual of Tau Beta Sigma was revised to reflect  the changes in the membership of the organization. A membership development program was also  implemented, providing chapters with suggestions and information on the recruitment and education  of Prospective Members and Candidates.

In 1995, at the National Convention in Orlando, Florida, the Sorority joined together to kick off  the celebration of the Fiftieth Anniversary of Tau Beta Sigma. Many special anniversary activities  took place including: commissioning a bust of the founder, Wava Banes Henry, initiating a National  Sisterhood Week, and burying a Time Capsule on the grounds of Stillwater Station. One of the main focuses of the 50th Anniversary Celebration was to begin laying the foundation  for Tau Beta Sigma’s next 50 years of service. Technological advances assisted with communication  reports and plans for a new marketing strategy to revitalize membership were developed. A Mission  Statement was created and then in 1997 a Strategic Planning Team was formed to allow the  organization to participate in long range-planning and goal setting. This type of global thinking was  introduced to all levels of the Sorority and has made us more efficient and successful. Reflecting the goals of the Mission Statement, the Women in Music Speakers Series was initiated  at the 1997 District Conventions. This series features open discussions with women who have made  important accomplishments in the music industry. The Women in Music Speaker Series was brought  to the 1997 National Convention when composer Anne McGinty addressed the delegation and again  in 1999 when composer Julie Giroux spoke to those in attendance. Tau Beta Sigma continues to grow and flourish in the 21st Century by reflecting the changes within  the membership, society, and the needs of the American Bands.  ...that we exist to serve bands and promote women in music. We work together with other musical  organizations to ensure that students have multiple resources to access and opportunities to serve,  teaching our students to build relationships and partnerships on a personal and organizational level. Today, Tau Beta Sigma is a co-educational national honorary band sorority dedicated to serving  college and band programs. The Sorority, headquartered at the historic Stillwater Station in Stillwater,  OK, numbers 3,000 active members in 140 active chapters, and over 40,000 alumni.  Tau Beta Sigma operates primarily as a student service and leadership recognition society whose chief  aim is to assist the Director of Bands in developing the leadership and enthusiasm that they require  of their band. Their goals are not only to provide the band with organized and concentrated service  activities, but to give their membership valid and wholesome experiences in organization, leadership  and social contacts. The honorary nature of membership is based on the premise that “it is an honor to  be selected to serve”—this band, its department of music, its sponsoring institution, and the cause of  band music in the nation’s colleges and universities. The Sorority’s mission is as follows: We provide exceptional service to collegiate bands and promote equality and diversity, including  empowering women in the band profession. We cultivate leadership, educational achievement, music  appreciation and community development.

Appendix L MORE HISTORICAL DOCUMENTS The PODIUM The Early Years of  Kappa Kappa Psi  Fraternity – Part 1 Aaron Moore National Alumni Historical and Development Coordinator Alpha Rho -  ΚΚΨ,  Northeastern State University Clinton Wieden Southwest District Governor Alpha -  ΚΚΨ , Oklahoma State University hough World War I ended in 1918  and most Americans were eager  for peace and security, 1919  would prove to be anything but.  T Revolution and unrest continued  to spread across Europe and North  America, a Flu Pandemic continued with  a third brutal wave in the spring, terrorist  bombings rocked seven U.S. cities in June  (the first of a series of “Red Scares” began  when the government passed an act that  blacklisted anyone thought to be involved  with communism), race riots rocked  the nation, and hundreds of workers  went on strike across the country. The  adoption of constitutional amendments  giving women the vote and establishing  Prohibition denoted the high-water mark  of the moral impulses of the Progressive  era. Set against this backdrop, William  A. Scroggs brought his idea of a band  fraternity to Oklahoma A&M College band  director Bohumil “Boh” Makovsky.  Boh  realized the need for such an organization,  and selected A. Frank Martin, Raymond D  Shannon, Clyde Haston, Clayton Soule,  Carl Stevens, William Coppedge, Dick  Hurst, Asher Hendrickson, and Iron H  Nelson to work with Scroggs to organize  the first local club.  Officers for the local  club were elected and William A. Scroggs  was elected the first chapter president. Many of the charter members were  members of social fraternities and were  aware of other fraternity rituals. During  the first year of operation as an honorary  society, the members kept busy laying out  the framework for the Fraternity they were  establishing.    They enlisted assistance  working out and adopting a national  constitution, creating and developing  30 - Kappa Kappa Psi & Tau Beta Sigma
appendices Bohumil “Boh” Makovsky served as Director of Bands  and Head of the Music Department at Oklahoma  A&M College from 1915-43.  He is known to members  of Kappa Kappa Psi as the “Guiding Spirit.”   the Ritual, designing the jewelry needed  to provide distinctive recognition for the  organization, and setting up plans for the  expansion of the Fraternity. The Greek  name and symbols, “Kappa Kappa Psi,”  were furnished by Dr. Hilton Ira Jones of  the OSU Chemistry faculty, and assistance  from Col. F.D. Wickham of the OSU Military  Department was instrumental in the  design of the Ritual. As the club continued to organize,  Scroggs, Martin, and Shannon signed  Articles of Incorporation in Payne County, 
Stillwater native William A. Scroggs  proposed the idea of a band Fraternity to  director Bohumil Makovsky in Fall 1919.  Oklahoma on March 3, 1920 for the “Kappa  Kappa Psi, Honorary Fraternity for College  Bandsmen.”  These Article of Incorporation  were approved by the State of Oklahoma  two days later. That same semester, the  1920 Oklahoma A & M Red and Black  annual published an announcement  to campus that the fraternity work was  completed and functioning.   While we look back on 100 years of  service to college bands, we were not  fundamentally a service organization for  the first thirty years of our existence. The 

Fraternity’s recruiting primarily  targeted upper class members.  The charter members of Kappa  Kappa Psi were all upperclassmen,  and began graduating in 1920  and 1922.  This approach was  taken in order to advance the  reputation they were trying to  build. Built along the lines of an  Honor Society, William A Scroggs  believed that Kappa Kappa Psi  could and should achieve the same  level of recognition as Phi Beta  Kappa.  The purposes of the new  organization were to assist the  band by assisting new members  socially, educationally, and by  encouraging better musical ability  in college bands.  The Alpha chapter, and the  Grand Officers, saw immediately  growing the Fraternity beyond  a local club as their primary  responsibility. In an age before  instantaneous communication,  this was an enormous task. The  Alpha chapter put out a call via  postal service and telegrams to  large stable colleges and well- established private school band  programs that would be good  foundations for the fraternity.  Having these programs as member  institutions would help in their goal to  improve the image and reputation of  the Fraternity. The schools that accepted  the call petitioned to become part of  the Kappa Kappa Psi.  The petitioning  processed differed then, as each active  chapter would receive a copy of the  petition for review, and would have a vote  on whether or not to accept the school  into the Fraternity. Following the approval of the first  petitions, trips were planned by train  to Montana State University and the  University of Washington to install the  Beta and Gamma chapters in December  1920.  The Delta chapter at the University  of Oklahoma was installed in May 1921.  However, at that time these chapters  may not have been known by those  names.  The earliest naming convention  for chapters was based on their state.  For  example, the Alpha chapter was known as  Oklahoma Alpha, while Delta was known  as Oklahoma Beta.  This naming style did  not last long since it became confusing.   Much of the early organization of  the Fraternity was handled by three men: 
appendices The Alpha Chapter of Kappa Kappa Psi at OAMC in  March 1950.    William A. Scroggs, Bohumil Makovsky,  and A. Frank Martin. Scroggs and  Makovsky continued their involvement  throughout all the early history of Kappa  Kappa Psi.  A. Frank Martin left Stillwater  and the involvement with the Fraternity  after serving as the first Grand President  from 1919-1922. By 1922, there was still little  organization to the functioning of the  national fraternity.  The Grand Council had  no definitive goals beyond expansion and  organizing in to something other than a  loose collection of far flung group of band  clubs from Oklahoma, Montana, Oregon,  Washington, Mississippi, Colorado, and  Pennsylvania. The next phase of fraternal  development was led by Scott Squyres of  the Delta chapter who served as second  (1922-1923) and third (1923-1926) Grand  President Scott Squyres.  Squyres was  a charter member of the Delta chapter  and was an accomplished individual and  prominent attorney in Oklahoma City.  He 
Fall 2019 was also a key figure in setting in  motion the honorary membership  and long-time support of John  Philip Sousa.  During Squyres’  terms as Grand President, he  also operated the National  Headquarters.  The Fraternity was  still developing its organizational  structure and procedures, and  the National Headquarters was  not much more than a place to  exchange fees for shingles and  pins.  While serving as Grand  President, Squyres began serving  in the role of Executive Secretary  in 1925.  However, his work and  involvement in other organizations  resulted in slow correspondence  with chapters.  This issue was  compounded by National  Headquarters relocating each time  Squyres’ law office would move. Another key figure in  the development of the early  Fraternity was J. Lee Burke from the  Eta Chapter.  Burke served as Grand  President from 1926 to 1927, and  his work has had a lasting impact  on the Fraternity.  An authority  on parliamentary procedure and  fraternity governance, J. Lee Burke  expanded the early constitution  into a comprehensive governing  document.  In recognition of his work,  he was later named Parliamentarian for  Life.  Conflict between Burke and Squyres  resulted in one of the earliest bouts  of political maneuvering in Fraternity  leadership, ultimately shortening Burke’s  terms as Grand President when Squyres  had the National Convention moved up  six months earlier than initially scheduled. Only ten years after the birth of the  Fraternity, the United States was wracked  by the Great Depression.  Already fighting  a tough financial situation, the Fraternity  was hit hard during this time when no  dues were being paid. “The Baton” was  forced to cease publication in 1930 due  to no money coming in from chapters.  During this time, Kappa Kappa Psi saw  its first shift in leadership.  From 1927- 29, Bohumil Makovsky served as Grand  President and was succeeded by Oscar  Lehrer from the Delta chapter in 1929- 1932.  These two individuals were the first  nationally prominent band directors to  serve in the leadership of Kappa Kappa  Psi. Expansion was still the heart of the  PODIUM.KKYTBS.ORG - 31

The PODIUM seal their records and deposit all chapter  records and materials for safekeeping  until such time as enough brothers  returned to campus to resume normal  operations. The intent of the furlough was  to allow chapters to immediately resume  operations after the war rather than  being considered an inactive chapter.  Applications required approval of both  the band director (or a faculty member  who was a member of the Fraternity) and  the president of the chapter’s college  or university. It is unknown today how  many chapters applied for a furlough,  as records are incomplete; two that are  known to have received a furlough are  the Alpha Theta chapter at the University  of Northern Colorado and the Alpha Xi  chapter at Stetson University. National Program National Program of Kappa Kappa Psi -  April 1942 In 1939, a policy adopted by the  Fraternity stipulated that the organization  would study about a different charter  member every year.  The education under  this policy started with William A. Scroggs  in 1939 and Boh Makovsky in 1940.  With  30 - Kappa Kappa Psi & Tau Beta Sigma
appendices his election to the reinterpreted office  of Grand 2nd Vice President in 1941,  Max Mitchell began his tenure on the  Grand Council by expanding this policy  to become the basis of his “National  Program.”  This program served as our  first national membership education  program and focused largely on band  and fraternity history.  Mitchell was also  an early advocate for the importance  of service as an aspect of fraternal  membership and included that in his  program.  The program was distributed to  chapters from 1941-1943, at which time  it was deemed unnecessary to continue  due to the declining number of chapters  and active members caused by the war.  Nine issues of Mitchell’s program issued  between November 1941 and March 1943  are housed in the Fraternity’s archive. Tau Beta Sigma In 1937, the band  at Texas Technological  College (now Texas  Tech University)  experienced two  major events: the  admission of women  and the chartering of  the Alpha Omicron  chapter of Kappa  Kappa Psi.  Over time,  Alpha Omicron’s  work inspired three  of the women in  the band to seek a  similar opportunity,  and during the 1939- 40 school year, an  organization called  Tau Beta Sigma was  created.  By 1941,  Tau Beta Sigma had  established its place at  Texas Tech and wanted  to expand to other  schools, which led  the group to contact  A. Frank Martin to  discuss expansion and  nationalization, as the  war effort had led to gender integration  in many college bands across the country.  Eventually, their discussions led to a  proposal to establish Tau Beta Sigma  nationally as an auxiliary organization of  Kappa Kappa Psi. However, internal discussion within  the Grand Council regarding Tau Beta 
Sigma was tense. The auxiliary proposal  sent to the still-active chapters of Kappa  Kappa Psi in 1943 found approval, but a  stipulation made by William A. Scroggs  to gain his vote was not met, leading to a  reopening of discussion within the Grand  Council and eventual referral of the matter  to the Board of Trustees, its first major  action for the Fraternity. These setbacks,  and the eventual decision of the Board to  delay the matter until after the conclusion  of World War II, caused the women of  Tau Beta Sigma to explore incorporation  as a separate organization, which  ultimately was successful. Texas Tech  band director D.O. Wiley suggested to A.  Frank Martin that the group incorporate  in Oklahoma, which was accepted. The  national organization of Tau Beta Sigma  was incorporated on March 26, 1946, and  was accepted as a sister organization of  Kappa Kappa Psi, sharing the National  Headquarters, national publication, and  other resources, at the 1947 National  Convention. (For more in-depth information  regarding the founding of Tau Beta Sigma,  you may order a copy of  From a Local  Group to a National Sorority: 1939-1947  from www.tbsigma.org.) Race in Fraternity  Membership In Fall 1946, the Nu Chapter at the  University of Michigan chose two African- American bandsmen as prospective  initiates: L. Allen Pyke and Marshall  M. Penn.  At that time, the National  Constitution restricted membership to  men of the Caucasian race, so the Nu  chapter submitted a proposal to A. Frank  Martin to remove the race restriction,  stating that “it is noted by this group that  no other national honorary fraternity  limits its membership according to race,  color, or creed.  By restricting membership  to the Caucasian race, this fraternity is not  in accord with one of the basic principles of  democracy.”  Having just passed through  a heated issue that was contested on  procedural grounds, Martin brought the  issue to the Grand Council, who all agreed  that changing the constitution was the  right thing to do.  However, that meant  waiting until the next biennial convention.   Martin informed the Nu chapter of these  details and encouraged them to submit  an amendment to be considered at the  next convention. A similar request was

WOMEN IN THE FRATERNITY by David Justin Author’s Note: This is the first (Podium Spring 2001) in a series chronicling the history of women in Kappa Kappa  Psi. Special thanks to Steve Nelson, Ken Corbett, Deb Eakins, Marie Burleigh, Rick Albani, Beth Smith, Ralph  Cicchelli, Jaki Fesq, Mu Upsilon, Alpha, and the National Headquarters staff for their help on this project. Prior to World War II, most band programs in the country were exclusively male and military in style.  With the outbreak of the war, many members of these bands found themselves in the armed forces.  This put a great deal of strain on the membership of Kappa Kappa Psi, eventually forcing 90 percent  of all chapters to shut down.  With so many of the Fraternity’s members, including members of the  Grand Council, fighting the Axis Powers of Germany, Italy and Japan, the Twelfth and Thirteenth   Biennial Conventions, scheduled for 1943 and 1945, were never held.  Kappa Kappa Psi was kept alive  by the efforts of A. Frank Martin, William Scroggs, and the five remaining active chapters (Alpha,  Oklahoma State University; Alpha Beta, Butler University; Alpha Iota, University of Colorado; Alpha  Omicron, Texas Tech University; and Alpha Pi, University of Tulsa). World War II also allowed many women to participate in band programs for the first time.  At Texas  Tech University, a local women’s organization called Tau Beta Sigma was formed in 1939, and in  1944 they petitioned the National Chapter of Kappa Kappa Psi to be allowed as an auxiliary chapter  of the Fraternity. Under this proposal, Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma would have been one  corporation, rather than two. Although there probably would have been two National Councils, there  would have been only one Board of Trustees having ultimate authority over both groups. Knowing that the very nature of college and university bands was changing, many of the Fraternity’s  prominent members such as Martin and Max Mitchell hoped that the petition for membership would  be granted. Due to the condition of the Fraternity during the war, however, this was not to be. “It is my firm conviction that eventually Kappa Kappa Psi, National Honorary Band Fraternity, should  be open to both college band men and women,” wrote Grand Second Vice President Max Mitchell  in a letter dated Jan. 12, 1944, to A. Frank Martin. ‘’At the same time, I realize that we cannot strike  out a direct course to this goal; because such a move could only be made after due publicity in all our  active chapters after the war and executed at a National Convention.” Mitchell recommended that Martin, as National Executive Secretary, try to help guide Tau Beta  Sigma during the war in order to gain a greater chance of adding these women to the roster of Kappa  Kappa Psi. Martin was very positive about the idea of adding the Tech organization to the Fraternity.  Having a daughter of his own, he felt that women should have every opportunity as men to develop  leadership  and advance in music and that Kappa Kappa Psi should allow them that opportunity. In a letter dated Jan. 25, 1944, to William Scroggs, Martin wrote, “If we do not meet this new  situation and give recognition to the girls who are coming into the bands or make it possible to give  aid or assistance to the many univer
appendices  sities and colleges that have bands composed of both boys and 

girls, we will be playing second fiddle within the next five years to some band fraternity that will grant  membership to boys and girls and their chapters will open up in the smaller schools where ours have  died. It is a new era and some of the best band directors in the United States are coming to the theory  that girls must be recognized and give the same as boys.” The members of Tau Beta Sigma ultimately decided not to be an auxiliary unit of Kappa Kappa Psi,  but rather a sister organization to the Fraternity. On March 26, 1946, Tau Beta Sigma was officially  chartered as a national organization. The issue of women joining the Fraternity would not become a  major national issue again until 1972. TITLE IX No person in the United States shall on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied  the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any educational program or activity receiving  Federal financial assistance... Title IX of the Education Act of 1972 Title IX of the Education Act of 1972 requires that all persons be allowed to participate in any  educational program, including those activities that receive direct federal aid, regardless of gender.  These programs or activities include any student organizations that operate under the authority or  recognition of a college or university that receives govern educational and professional opportunities, and therefore fall under the Tide IX influence. There are  some exceptions to the rule: social fraternities and sororities, voluntary youth service organiza boy or girl conferences, etc. The clause has primarily affected athletics but it has also made its impact  on honorary organizations, such as Kappa Kappa Psi. THE RUTGERS INCIDENT Kappa Kappa Psi was given its first test of Title IX in what is now known as the “Rutgers Incident.”  Rutgers University, the State University of New Jersey, was home to the Alpha Phi chapter. Rutgers began experiencing problems with the national office in 1971 when the National Chapter  voted to raise dues in order to help cover the cost of maintenance for the frater notice this increase, and, after failing to cover the shortage of $39.06 by February 1, 1972, they were  placed on suspension. The chapter was not happy with this situation and was becoming disenchanted  with the national organization. In a letter to National Executive Secretary Robert H. Rubin, dated February 17, 1972, the Alpha Phi  chapter wrote, “This has come down to our rather self-centered question of ‘What has the national  [organization] done for us?’ This issue has been raised within our chapter because it is our feeling that  the national organization, which exists for the purpose of administering Kappa Kappa Psi, has become

 tions,   nity. Alpha Phi did not 

more important than the goals of this service fraternity. In other words, we feel that the national has  become so bureaucratic in nature that the goals of Kappa Kappa Psi have been relegated to a role of  secondary importance. Hence, our present impression of national is that of a callous administrative  system which is primarily concerned with money. We want an explanation of what services the  national organization provides for our chapter.” After the delinquent dues were paid, Rutgers was re to be going well until the Rutgers University Board of Governors decided that they wanted their  school to serve as a leader and model for the rest of the nation in implementing Tide IX. In the spring  of 1972, they issued a mandate that all organizations on the Rutgers campus become coed within  the year or face disciplinary actions. For the first time in its history, the Rutgers University Marching  Band became coed. Ralph Cicchelli, the Alpha Phi president, regarded the coed issue as very minor in light of the  ongoing war in Vietnam. He had been in the eleventh group of men that were drafted, but was  granted exemption based on his status as a full-time college student. He was a senior during the 1972- 1973 school year and his exemption from military duty was almost at an end. Thinking of the physical demands placed on the students during band camp by the director of bands,  Cicchelli had only expected to see one or two women, whom he felt would surely be scared off,  enrolled in the band. When the marching season began, however, he was shocked to learn that there  were ten women enrolled and, as it turned out, as the flute and clarinet section rank leader he had the  majority of them in his squad. “The gals were fit, tough as nails, and took the challenge and snickering as a challenge to prove they  were worthy,” he said. “I gained complete faith in their ability.” After surviving band camp, the brothers of Alpha Phi gained a new respect for the women that had  joined the Rutgers band. Knowing that their own numbers were dwindling, they began to contemplate  giving bids to the women that they felt were worthy of membership. Realizing that the National Constitution prohibited the admittance of women in the organization,  Alpha Phi initially explored the option of beginning a Tau Beta Sigma chapter. However, because  Douglass College, the undergraduate college for women at Rutgers, prohibited the formation of or  participation in any kind of sorority; the creation of a Tau Beta Sigma chapter was not considered an  option as no women from Douglass would be allowed to join. Rutgers Band Director Scott Whitener’s motto that year was “a bandmember is a bandmember,”  meaning that the women would be treated no differently from the men and that the women would be  held to the same expectations as the men.

“I believe this is the phrase that not only solidified the marching band, but it became the anthem, so  to speak, for all future action,” said Jaki Fesq, a junior who was one of the first women to enter the  Rutgers marching band. Based on these factors, the Alpha Phi chapter voted to admit women on October 8, 1972. Knowing  their actions would have consequences, the brothers of Alpha Phi informed National Headquarters of  their intentions and invited National Secretary Rubin to Rutgers to discuss the matter and also to hear  their reasons for Alpha Phi’s remaining a part of the national organization. Alpha Phi Vice President and District IX Member-at-Large Bill Ferenkes sent letters to other  members of the District IX Council asking for support of their decision, in hopes that Rutgers’  decision would front a movement at the 1973 National Convention at the University of Connecticut  to merge Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma into one single coed fraternity. Rubin requested that the Rutgers chapter not administer any part of the Ritual before he could visit.  He was also hoping that they would hold off on initiation until after the 1973 National Convention  at the University of Connecticut. This would give the National Council an opportunity to establish a  policy statement concerning Title IX and would allow the National Chapter the chance to amend the  Constitution. On November 11, 1972, Rubin visited Rutgers only to discover that the chapter had already  performed the Ritual of the First Degree, thus beginning a formal probationary membership in  Kappa Kappa Psi. According to a letter to the National Council, dated November 13, 1972, Rubin  immediately suspended the chapter, recalled their charter, and refused to discuss any other matters. He  stated, “The chapter knowingly, intentionally, and with prior consideration of all circumstances chose  to violate the most basic principle of the membership section of our Constitution. They expected some form of compromise by the National Fraternity on their behalf, feeling that the integrity of the  national organization was less than their own. They did not appear to be at all prepared when no such  compromise or accommodation materialized.” Not knowing how to respond to their suspension, the members of Alpha Phi unanimously voted to  continue the probationary membership for their candidates despite Rubin. “I was under an incredibly naïve (in retrospect)  understanding that Mr. Rubin was only coming to  observe and perhaps utilize us as a model for spreading coed pledging elsewhere,” Cicchelli recalls  today. “That easily explains why we were ‘unprepared’ for the consequences after he pulled the plug.  We thought he was coming to praise us, not to bury us, so to speak.”  On November 13, the former members of the suspended Alpha Phi chapter officially chartered Mu  Upsilon Alpha, the Honorary, Coeducational Service Fraternity of the Rutgers University Bands.

During the next year, the new brothers of Mu Upsilon Alpha sent letters to all the chapters of Kappa  Kappa Psi explaining why they chose to leave the fraternity. The responses that they received ranged  from hate mail to support for their ideas. However, the one thing that Rutgers was criticized for time  and time again was their action in violation of the National Constitution. Chapters that were willing  to support the idea of allowing women in the Fraternity felt that the Alpha Phi chapter should have  waited until the 1973 National convention to address the issue so that the constitution could be  amended to allow for it.  The National Council offered Alpha Phi the opportunity to appeal their suspension to the National  Student Advisory Committee at the 1973 National Convention, but Mu Upsilon Alpha declined,  stating, “In practical terms, a local brotherhood of 45 can serve the Rutgers Bands in a far greater  capacity than a nationally affiliated brotherhood of 18.”  Numerous attempts have been made to bring the Alpha Phi chapter back into the Brotherhood,  but they have all met with failure. Today, Mu Upsilon Alpha averages forty to sixty active members  per year and will celebrate its thirtieth anniversary in 2002. They are a very active coed organization  serving the Rutgers University band program and are also responsible for running the New Jersey All- State Band each year.  ******************************* It is important to note that the Rutgers Incident took place during the end of the Vietnam War,  although very few people knew that it was about to end. Many people, such as Ralph Cicchelli, were  torn between their loyalties to serve their country and their moral objections of being in the war.  The idea of fighting against the National Constitution was a direct result of those torn loyalties and  objections. For those men in Alpha Phi, the time for change was today, as tomorrow threatened to  take them into a war that would very likely take their lives.  Editor’s Note: This a series chronicling the history of women in Kappa Kappa Psi; part 1 appeared in the spring  2001 issue. The 1973 National Convention Brothers, we must be at UCONN in ’73, for things of great importance to the fraternity will be  discussed and voted. Gordon E. Maroney, III, National Member-at-Large The PODIUM, spring 1973 The passage of Title IX threatened to redefine the most basic requirement for membership for all- male honor societies such as Kappa Kappa Psi by allowing women to join. The issue was predominant  on the minds of the Grand Council as they prepared for the 1973 National Convention at the 
appendices

University of Connecticut in Storrs, Connecticut. The council strongly encouraged attendance so that  all voices could be heard and so that this issue could be addressed. “To sit by the band hall and hope this shall pass from us is foolish thinking,” Maroney continued in  his PODIUM letter. “We must meet, discuss all aspects affecting us and decide what must be done  now.” As the chair of the National Student Advisory Committee, he invited all brothers in attendance at  the National Convention to attend the meetings of the committee and to express their feelings and  observations about the issue of allowing women in the fraternity. Constitutionally, the committee was  chaired by the National Member-at-Large, now known as the National Vice President for Student  Affairs, and consisted of the district presidents. Other members of the fraternity were allowed to sit in  on this committee, but were not usually encouraged to do so. National Executive Secretary Robert Rubin also addressed the issue in his PODIUM letter. He asked  very direct questions that he hoped would be answered at UCONN. “What policy must we adopt to meet the requirements of [Title IX]?” he asked. “How can we also  meet the needs of those who have already challenged our current governing document on this basis?… Is there really a need for two separate societies based on sexist selectivity within one collegiate band  program? Would not one coed society serve as well?” When the convention finally began, Grand President Richard “Doc” Worthington addressed the issue  in his official Report “A big challenge to the fraternity during the past biennium, at this meeting of  the Grand Chapter, and in the future will be the [Education Amendments],” he said. “It has caused  the ‘Rutgers’ incident in which a chapter was suspended because of ignoring the National Constitution  and initiating women into their chapter in violation of this constitution. If women are to become a  part of Kappa Kappa Psi, let it be done in an orderly manner with open discussion at a Grand Chapter  meeting and not in open defiance to the National Constitution.” He went on to give some options that would make the fraternity compliant with Title IX. Among  those suggestions was the idea of merging Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma into a single “unisex”  organization. Richard Alder, a Life Member from the Nu chapter at the University of Michigan served as the chair  of the jurisdiction committee at the convention. “There was no buzz on merger in 1973,” he recalled when asked about the possibility of a merger in  Storrs. “The Rutgers Incident was an anomaly that I think many chapters just preferred to ignore  – chapter violated rules, chapter suspended, end of discussion in many people’s minds. If you’re not  prepared to break down the gender barrier on

membership, then you’re nowhere near thinking merger.” However, Alder and his jurisdiction committee did discuss the possibility of changing the National  Constitution. The idea was to propose an amendment that would take out the “male” reference out of  the membership requirements. “I wanted to push the idea, and found the committee not totally sold on the idea,” Alder said. “J. Lee  [Burke]’s suggestion was that the committee could propose an amendment ‘without prejudice’ which  would put it before the membership for a vote without a recommendation either for or against from the  committee.” Burke, the third Grand President, was the Fraternity’s parliamentarian for life. He constantly advised  and coached the jurisdiction and was more knowledgeable about the National Constitution than  anyone in the Fraternity. The committee accepted this compromise on the amendment proposal. The proposed amendment  would read delete section 7.02 of the national constitution, which stated, “All members of the Fraternity  shall be of the male sex.” Prior to the jurisdiction committee report, Maroney presented the report of the National Student  Advisory Committee. Their recommendation on the subject was not shock to the all-male membership. Section VI, part 2 of the advisory committee report stated, “It is recommended that no action be made  on the part of Kappa Kappa Psi [or] its component parts, to change the present Constitution in any  manner in regard to the stipulation that members be of the male sex, and that merger with Tau Beta  Sigma not be considered at this time.” When Alder presented the jurisdiction report and read the proposal to section 7.02, the delegation sat  in shocked silence. Finally, one member asked, “What does this mean?” Alder responded that any member of the band in good standing may be considered for membership.  There was little discussion on the amendment and less support as the amendment was defeated by over  75 percent of the voting body. A moment later, Section 7.02 was amended by the delegation to read, “All active, alumni, inactive, and  life members of the Fraternity be of the male sex.” With this wording, the door was now open to constitutionally accept women into the Fraternity as  honorary members. But the possibility of allowing women in as active members was closed.

The National Response Many chapters in the country began to feel the pressure of Title IX as their school administrations  began to express their concerns about their lack of female members. Some chapters, such as the Alpha  Chapter at Oklahoma State University, the Iota Chapter at the Georgia Institute of Technology, and  the Delta Omicron Chapter at the University of Connecticut, were in danger of being forced to leave  their university if they did not comply. At the 1975 National Convention in Houston, Grand President Thomas Tyra made the issue of Title  IX an important part of the convention. He wrote in his report, “We need to consider the implications of the Federal Government’s Title  IX Guidelines to the Federal Education Act which prohibits discrimination by sex in any honorary  organization on a college campus which receives Federal funds.” The Jurisdiction Committee, chaired by Mike Radice of the Epsilon Xi chapter at Miami University,  made the recommendation that a committee be formed, comprised of an equal number of members  of Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma members to investigate the laws of Oklahoma in regards to  corporate merger and to report their findings at the 1977 National Convention. However, due to the  events that would take place at the 1977 National Convention, that report would never be read. The National Student Advisory Committee, under the leadership of Glenn Anderson, National  Member-at-Large, made many recommendations to help comply with Title IX. They recommended  that all references to gender be removed from the national constitution; that Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau  Beta Sigma be restructured so that both organizations would have identical fee structures, national  offices, and hierarchy; and that strong ties between joint chapters be encouraged. But the hope for a single-sex organization was still in their minds. They requested that the newly appointed National Executive Secretary, W. Frank Evans, investigate  the lobbying efforts being organized to counter the Title IX guidelines. If the efforts seemed to be  working, Evans was to establish the fraternity as a participant in that group.` However, in the Winter 1977 issue of The PODIUM, Evans addressed the issue of a hearing with the  Department of Health, Education and Welfare.  “Hopes for obtaining such a hearing have been completely extinguished, and it has become imperative  that the National Constitution be altered to delete all mention of specific sex,” he said in the article.  “Chapters who have experienced Title IX problems during the current year can testify to the fact that  they will not be allowed to operate on campus next fall if definite action is not taken. The altering of  our National Constitution will not be the complete solution to the Title IX problem, and the lasting  effects which will result from this action will need to be seriously considered.”

In preparation for the 1977 National Convention at the University of California at Los Angeles,  Grand President Melbern Nixon wrote to J. Lee Burke on July 5, 1977, asked for his help in dealing  with two issues. “It appears now that we will have two quite controversial subjects with which to deal,” he wrote in  the letter. “One, of course, is the matter of redistricting. The other is the much more ‘sticky’ subject of  merger. There are those who feel quite strongly on both sides of the issue.” On the opening day of the convention, the delegates were told that there would be a special joint  meeting of the Fraternity and the Sorority on the morning of the second day to discuss the subject of  merger. The special meeting was held with speakers to present pro and con-arguments before the joint  delegation. Speaking in favor of merger was Scott Donaldson from the Eta Beta Chapter of Kappa  Kappa Psi at Virginia Polytechnic and State University. Speaking against merger was Brenda Joyce  from the Psi Chapter of Tau Beta Sigma at the University of Arkansas and Michael Leckhum from  the Delta Upsilon Chapter of Kappa Kappa Psi at Eastern Michigan University. The Nu Chapter of Kappa Kappa Psi and the Lambda chapter of Tau Beta Sigma from the University  of Michigan were approached to speak on behalf of merger, but they refused. After the 1973 National  Convention, the chapter at Michigan had begun discussing and promoting merger anyone who would  listen. From 1973 to 1977, they tried to gain support for the idea, but eventually grew to realize that  merger wasn’t the way to go. “Our refusal to speak for or against in 1977 was due to our chapters’ growth to the concept of ‘fusion’  – chapters working together for the common good of the band program in whatever form was most  appropriate for them,” Rich Alder explain today . “There was simply too much diversity in to dictate  one way for all.”  The Michigan chapters also realized that merger would mean the end of one of the two organizations,  or possible both. A formal vote on merger was taken by secret ballot when the delegations split and went their separate  ways. Both organizations voted overwhelmingly against merger. The Kappa Kappa Psi vote was 211  against and 9 for. The Tau Beta Sigma vote was 104 against and 4 for. The possibility of merger was  officially denied. In the days that followed, the Fraternity officially removed all gender references from the constitution  by unanimous vote, finally making the national constitution complaint with the Education  Amendments of 1972. Women were now constitutionally allowed to become active members of  Kappa Kappa Psi in full and regular standing.

The Merger at Arizona State  In the years prior to 1976, the Beta Omicron Chapter of Kappa Kappa Psi and the Sigma Chapter of  Tau Beta Sigma at Arizona State University saw their membership decline. Friction began to grow  between the two groups, and members began to lash out at one another. “The chapters’ membership had dwindled down to eight for Kappa Kappa Psi and ten for Tau Beta  Sigma,” Leslie Anderson, past Beta Omicron Chapter president recalled. “There was a lot of animosity  between the two groups.”  In an effort to release some of that tension and under the supervision of Dr. Robert “Coach” Fleming,  then-assistant director of bands, the chapters decided to merge into one organization, combining all  aspects of their chapters with the exception of their rituals. In January 1977, the chapters presented a letter to the national officers requesting permission to  completely merge: We have found that through joint projects we are able to accomplish more with less  internal conflict. By working together, our fraternal functions have become more productive, beneficial  and rewarding to the individual members. Therefore, the chapters have decided unanimously to  request your permission to merge. (letter from Beta Omicron & Sigma, January 26, 1977) After returning from the 1977 National Convention at the University of California at Los Angeles  where the National Constitution was amended to remove all mention of gender, the women of the  Sigma Chapter voted unanimously to become members of Kappa Kappa Psi.  On August 26, 1977, Patricia A. Childress, Lydia L. Lennon, Leslie A. Anderson, Mary L. Duffala,  Mary M. Ketterer, Kristina M. Zipsnis, Clara M. Bertilson, and Toni Ryon were initiated into Beta  Omicron. On August 27, 1977, Lea F. Fuller was initiated. Today, if two chapters merge, the members from the other organization are known as Associate  Members, but as that membership status did not exist in 1977, these women are known as the first  active women in Kappa Kappa Psi. The merger became a huge success for Beta Omicron. The first election resulted in a female president,  secretary, and historian. That year, they initiated twenty-three new members bringing their chapter  total to forty-one brothers. The first election resulted in a female president, secretary, and historian.

GENDER AND OUR NATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS Spring 2019 Podium by Christopher Lukasik  Life Member, Delta Delta -  University of Massachusetts - Amherst One of the aspects I love about Tau Beta Sigma and Kappa Kappa Psi is our ability to welcome  anyone into the organization. The only requirements we have is to have a passion for the band, and  a passion for service. If you join with those two concepts as your baselines, you’re going to have a  wonderful experience in the organization(s). What is not a requirement for TBS or KKPsi is a certain  gender identity. For over 40 years, the national organizations have welcomed people of all genders. For  TBS, we have had gender inclusivity for longer than half of our existence.  Gender inclusivity is a sustainable membership tool. It opens up opportunity to people that, in the  past, would be restrained to only one option or no option at all. Overall, when a chapter is gender  inclusive it gives them a larger pool of candidates. It allows for potential members to have a choice,  and it allows for chapters to have wider recruitment strategies. Each organization offers something  different to its members, and giving potential candidates an opportunity to decide which mission,  vision, and programming would best benefit them is essential.  Gender identification transcends race, culture, origin, religion, etc. Some cultures have more than  two genders engrained, some do not. Either way, more than two genders do exist in society. In the  United States, gender identity and gender exploration is quickly becoming part of our day-to-day  conversations. Many research disciplines have endorsed this concept.  In 1977, our National Organizations became “co-ed” to allow for people of the opposite gender to  join either organization. Between 1977 and 2015, it became common practice that we were not solely  “co-ed” but we were gender inclusive. In 2015, the National Organizations codified that practice into  policy to state that we do not discriminate on the basis of any gender identity. We made sure it was  clear that any bandsperson is allowed to experience Tau Beta Sigma and Kappa Kappa Psi. This policy  only strengthened our organizations.  “Sister” and “Brother” are titles in our organization. Those titles have no bearing on a member’s  gender identity. I have proudly used the word Sister to describe myself in Tau Beta Sigma because  it is a title of honor. From conversations with Brothers in Kappa Kappa Psi, I know that Brother is  a title of honor as well. Tau Beta Sigma and Kappa Kappa Psi have transcended society’s engrained  understanding of gender and have been able to turn these words into honorable titles. I find that  concept exciting and empowering.

I do recognize that each campus across the United States is different, and each come with their own  culture. That said, I want to urge all chapters to examine their common practices and ask yourselves  if you are missing out on potential members that would be a wonderful addition to your chapter.  Opening your doors to everyone could further sustain your chapter on your campus. Not everyone is  suited for Tau Beta Sigma, and not everyone is suited for Kappa Kappa Psi, but everyone should be  able to make that decision for themselves.
