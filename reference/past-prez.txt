Psi, unanimously elected at the 2023 National Convention in Orlando, FL, and
distinguished as the first Asian American member to hold this prestigious

the theme “THE KAPPA KAPPA PSI JOURNEY,” which focused on collective growth
and strategic initiatives like the “Months of Focus,” highlighting Service,

nationwide. As National President, Bang oversaw major leadership transitions,

Affairs, and the search process for a new National Executive Director,
ensuring stability and preparedness for the Fraternity’s future. Throughout
his leadership, Bang prioritized the Fraternity’s safety and longevity, a
purposeful member experience, and upholding promises to lead Kappa Kappa Psi
into its second century. He approached each challenge with compassion,
diplomacy, and ethical reasoning.

Bang earned his Bachelor’s and Master’s Degrees from Indiana University in
2014 and 2016, respectively, and a Certificate in Non-Profit Executive
Management from Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy. His
fraternal journey began with his initiation into the Alpha Zeta chapter at
Indiana University in 2012, where he embraced leadership roles and
demonstrated a commitment to excellence. In 2016, he was honored with the
prestigious J. Lee Burke Student Achievement Award, Kappa Kappa Psi’s highest
student honor.

During his time at IU, Bang was a highly involved member of the Marching
Hundred, serving as a Piccolo Section Leader (2012-2014) and Drum Major
(2014-2016). His dedication and contributions earned him recognitions such as
the Alan Chepregi Memorial Scholarship and the “Most Outstanding Band Member”
award, the highest honor for a student in the Marching Hundred. As an alumnus,
Bang continues to be recognized for his contributions, receiving the Newell
Hillis Long Award at the 2024 IU Homecoming, honoring alumni who exemplify
exceptional professional standards.

Professionally, Bang serves as the Assistant Director of Alumni Relations &
Individual Gifts at the Jacobs School of Music at Indiana University. In this
role, he strategically engages alumni through innovative programming and
fosters meaningful connections within the music community. Bang also lends his
expertise as a Board Member and Fundraising Chair for The Musicianship, a
music education non-profit in the DC Metro area, and as a member of the IU API
Alumni Association. These roles reflect his deep commitment to education,
leadership development, and community impact.

Bang is also one of the Assistant Directors of the Crossroads Drum Major &
Leadership Clinic. He has been a member of the staff since 2013 and has spent
several years as a Leadership Clinician, mentoring and inspiring the next
generation of student leaders in the marching arts. His contributions to music
education and leadership development exemplify his lifelong passion for
supporting others and fostering growth.

adopted by the delegates at the 18th Biennial Convention held in 1955 at Ohio
State University. Frederick Fennell served as guest conductor of the National

National President 1951-1953

Hugh E. McMillen

HUGH E. McMILLEN (Alpha Iota), former Director of Bands at the University of
Colorado, was elected Grand President at the 16th Biennial Convention, 1951,
held at Indiana University. Brother McMillian was most helpful in presenting
the Fraternity and its program to new bands where he held clinics. He believed
that Kappa Kappa Psi should offer something constructive to college and
university bands. To provide this, he initiated our program of “commissioning”
some noted composer to write a special work for bands, to be presented at each
National Convention and premiered by the National Intercollegiate Band at the
finale convention concert. Don Gillis was the first composer to be
commissioned by Kappa Kappa Psi, and his Ballet for Band became part of
concert band literature. The National Intercollegiate Band’s finale concert
was conducted by Dr. A. Austin Harding at the 17th Biennial Convention in 1953
held at Texas Tech University.

National President 1949-1951

W. Theodore Jones

W. THEODORE JONES (Alpha Zeta), a graduate of Indiana University, was elected
Grand President at the Fifteenth Biennial Convention in 1949 at the University
of Colorado. He gave to the Fraternity much experience in chapter, district
and national offices. His greatest interest was directed to creating a closer
relationship between the sponsor and the chapter. During his term of office,
thirteen new chapters were established. In recognition of the outstanding
service given to Kappa Kappa Psi as the sponsor of one of the largest chapters
in the Fraternity, as well as the professional service given the organization
as guest conductor of the 1949 National Intercollegiate Band, the 1949
National Convention honored Dr. William D. Revelli, Director of Bands at the
University of Michigan, by electing him to the position of Grand Honorary
President of the Fraternity.

National President 1947-1949

Dr. Max A. Mitchell

DR. MAX A. MITCHELL (Alpha), former Director of Oklahoma State University
Bands, was elected Grand President in 1947. Under his term of office, the
Fraternity made one of its greatest showings in development and growth.
Brother Mitchell centered his interest in selling the Fraternity program to
the band directors of the United States and was instrumental in establishing
fifteen new chapters in Kappa Kappa Psi. He also advanced the theory that the
Fraternity was not only an “honorary” organization but should serve as a
“service” unit as well. Tau Beta Sigma was established to assist in carrying
on the college and university bands of America which had suffered from the
shortage of men in their ranks. Brother Mitchell gave all aid possible toward
helping Tau Beta Sigma become a national organization, devoted to meeting the
social, educational and musical needs of college and university bandswomen. He
succeeded in presenting the idea of having the Sorority as the “sister”
organization of Kappa Kappa Psi. Tau Beta Sigma was officially recognized and
accepted by the Fraternity at the first Kappa Kappa Psi convention following
the war in 1947. In the meantime the Sorority shared the National Office and
the magazine with the Fraternity on a prorated basis.

National President 1941-1947

Dr. F. Lee Bowling

DR. F. LEE BOWLING (Alpha Iota), University of Colorado, was elected as the
Grand President at the 11th Biennial Convention, held in 1941 at Oregon State
University. With a new constitution, a reorganization which created districts
with Governors to assist in an expansion program, and with the Fraternity’s
magazine expanded and renamed The PODIUM, the Fraternity’s future looked
bright. However, World War II brought drastic changes; only five chapters were
able to remain active during the conflict due to loss of members to the war
effort. Following the war, a program and a set of procedures had to be
developed to reactivate dormant chapters. With the assistance of band
directors, national officers, and district governors, everything began to
function again. The 12th Biennial Convention scheduled for 1943 and the 13th
Biennial Convention scheduled for 1945 were not held. The 14th Biennial
Convention was held at Oklahoma State University in Stillwater in 1947. It was
at this convention that Kappa Kappa Psi inaugurated the “National
Intercollegiate Band.” The National Intercollegiate Band was Dr. Bowling’s
cherished ideal, and through the years he had worked to develop a plan that
firmly established the organization as a national service project for the
Fraternity and Sorority. Dr. William D. Revelli served as guest conductor for
the Second National Intercollegiate Band in 1949.

National President 1939-1941

Francis R. Todd

FRANCIS R. TODD (Upsilon), from the Cincinnati University (now University of
Cincinnati), was elected Grand President at the Tenth Biennial Convention held
in Cincinnati in 1939. It was here that the delegates moved to reorganize the
Fraternity, adopt a new constitution, and place the work of the Fraternity on
a more sound financial foundation. A. Frank Martin (Alpha) was elected as
National Executive Secretary and Editor, a post he was to hold for over
twenty-five years. The next two years were spent in re-establishing the
publication of the magazine (discontinued during the Depression years) and
setting up an expansion program. Brother Todd gave to the Fraternity the sound
administration and leadership which the times required and his expansion
program had just begun to show results when the beginning of World War II
signaled an abrupt halt to fraternal activities “for the duration.”

National President 1937-1939

William R. Wehrend

WILLIAM R. WEHREND (Delta), former Director of the University of Oklahoma
Band, was chosen as the Grand President at the Ninth Biennial Convention in
Denver, Colorado, in 1937. Brother Wehrend faced the task of reviving and
revitalizing the Fraternity, a job which he tackled with uncommon zeal.
Through his tireless efforts, coupled with his underlying faith in the
principles of Kappa Kappa Psi, and his willingness to give his best to the
Fraternity, made it possible for Kappa Kappa Psi to be reorganized at the next
National Convention. The National Office was established at Norman, Oklahoma,
with Herman Zeimer (Delta) appointed as the Fraternity’s second National
Executive Secretary.

National President 1935-1937

John E. Howard

JOHN E. HOWARD (1935-1937; Mu), Director of the University of North Dakota
Bands, was advanced to the office of Grand President at the Eighth Biennial
Convention held at the Claypoole Hotel in Indianapolis, Indiana, in 1935.
Brother Howard waged an uphill fight for the life of the Fraternity from 1935
to 1937. The “Depression Era” took its toll, and many chapters were forced to
go inactive because of the economic conditions in the nation. During this
period of stress and strain, only the faith and confidence of Brother Howard
kept the organization together.

National President 1932-1935

J. B. Vandaworker

J. B. VANDAWORKER (Alpha Beta), former Director of the Butler University Band,
was elected Grand President at the Seventh Biennial Convention in 1932.
Brother Vandaworker was widely known throughout the United States for his
outstanding work as director of the “Indianapolis Newsboys’ Band.” In his
travels over the nation, he carried on an active campaign to spread the ideals
of Kappa Kappa Psi. The May 1933 issue of The Baton was dedicated to the
memory of John Philip Sousa, a cherished member of the Fraternity. Sousa was
just as proud of Kappa Kappa Psi as the Fraternity was of him. During Sousa’s
fraternal years, he was entertained by many Kappa Kappa Psi Chapters
throughout the United States, and each of them found him to be a true Brother
and an inspiration to and for Kappa Kappa Psi.

National President 1929-1932

Oscar J. Lehrer

OSCAR J. LEHRER (Delta), former Director of Bands at the University of
Oklahoma, was chosen Grand President at the Fifth Biennial Convention held in
Oklahoma City in 1929. Some of the issues discussed at this convention were
Fraternity music, such as songs and marches, making The Baton a finer
publication for the band world, and more ideas in conducting state high school
band contests. Six chapters came into the Fraternity during his leadership,
which was characterized by internal reorganization and stabilization within
the National Office. The Sixth Biennial Convention scheduled for 1931 was not
held.

National President 1927-1929

Bohumil “Boh” Makovsky

BOHUMIL MAKOVSKY (Alpha), former Director of the Oklahoma State University
Band, was elected Grand President at the Fourth Biennial Convention held in
Oklahoma City in 1927. He brought to the Fraternity the experienced leadership
needed to enlist the aid of established professional college band directors in
making the organization truly a national one. Brother Makovsky’s continued
interest, counsel, and guidance, spanning a thirty-five year fraternal career,
earned for him the title “The Guiding Spirit of Kappa Kappa Psi.” Nine new
chapters were established during his term of office.

National President 1926-1927

Dr. J. Lee Burke

DR. J. LEE BURKE (Eta), of Ohio State University, was elected as Grand
President at the Third National Convention, held at Oklahoma City in 1926.
Brother Burke stabilized the constitutional framework and administrative
structure of Kappa Kappa Psi. Having brought his own local band club into the
Fraternity, he also brought to the young organization its first set of
comprehensive by-laws and parliamentary procedures. As Grand President, Burke
did much to get each chapter to see the purpose and value of the Fraternity
from its national viewpoint. Four chapters were added during his term. Scott
Squyers (Delta) was appointed as the Fraternity’s first National Executive
Secretary, serving in that post until 1937, with offices located in Oklahoma
City.

National President 1922-1926

Scott P. Squyers

SCOTT P. SQUYERS (Delta), from the University of Oklahoma, was elected Grand
President at the First National Convention, held on the campus of Oklahoma
State University on January 2, 1922. Here, plans for expansion of the
Fraternity were set up and the first set of national officers were elected.
The Fraternity enjoyed a successful era of expansion under the leadership of
Brother Squyers. Ten new chapters were added to the young Fraternity during
his administration as Grand President, and the Second National Convention was
held in Oklahoma City in 1923. This proved to be a good central location, and
all active chapters were represented.

National President 1919-1922

A. Frank Martin

A. FRANK MARTIN (Alpha), from Oklahoma A&M College (now Oklahoma State
University), was elected as the first Grand President of Kappa Kappa Psi.
Letters were sent out to ten universities throughout the country telling of
the new organization. Five replies were received, all which expressed approval
of such an organization and its great potential. Late in fall 1920, Brother
Scroggs and Raymond Shannon traveled to Bozeman, Montana and installed the
“Beta Chapter” at Montana State College (now Montana State University) on
December 17, 1920.
